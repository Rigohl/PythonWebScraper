"""Refactored modules for the PythonWebScraper project.

This package mirrors the layout of the upstream ``src`` directory and
contains improved versions of several modules.  When used as a dropâ€‘in
replacement the refactored modules offer clearer APIs, better type
annotations and enhanced testability while preserving backwards
compatibility.
