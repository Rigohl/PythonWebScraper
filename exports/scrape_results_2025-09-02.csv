**Born:** March 14, 1879 in Ulm, Germany

**Description:**

In 1879, Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany. He completed his Ph.D. at
the University of Zurich by 1909. His 1905 paper explaining the photoelectric
effect, the basis of electronics, earned him the Nobel Prize in 1921. His
first paper on Special Relativity Theory, also published in 1905, changed the
world. After the rise of the Nazi party, Einstein made Princeton his permanent
home, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1940. Einstein, a pacifist during World War
I, stayed a firm proponent of social justice and responsibility. He chaired
the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists, which organized to alert the
public to the dangers of atomic warfare.At a symposium, he advised: ""In their
struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to
give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear
and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In
their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are
capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity
itself. This is, to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy
task . . . "" (""Science, Philosophy and Religion, A Symposium,"" published by
the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in their Relation to the
Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941). In a letter to philosopher Eric
Gutkind, dated Jan. 3, 1954, Einstein stated: ""The word god is for me nothing
more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a
collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless
pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change
this,"" (The Guardian, ""Childish superstition: Einstein's letter makes view of
religion relatively clear,"" by James Randerson, May 13, 2008). D. 1955.While
best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been
dubbed ""the world's most famous equation""), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize
in Physics ""for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his
discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"". The latter was pivotal in
establishing quantum theory.Einstein thought that Newtonion mechanics was no
longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of
the electromagnetic field. This led to the development of his special theory
of relativity. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could
also be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of
gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity.
He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum
theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of
molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the
foundation of the photon theory of light.He was visiting the United States
when Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 and did not go back to Germany. On the
eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt
alerting him to the potential development of ""extremely powerful bombs of a
new type"" and recommending that the U.S. begin similar research. This
eventually led to what would become the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported
defending the Allied forces, but largely denounced the idea of using the newly
discovered nuclear fission as a weapon. Later, with Bertrand Russell, Einstein
signed the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, which highlighted the danger of nuclear
weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.His great intellectual
achievements and originality have made the word ""Einstein"" synonymous with
genius.More:

moralism. Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and
empowerment in the face of moralistic and puritan constraints, and gravitates
around his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-
exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, even to the
point of owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's
values. His political activity is informed by the same ethos, as suggested by
his repudiation of communism after his 1936 voyage to the USSR.","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

See also: Robert GalbraithAlthough she writes under the pen name J.K. Rowling,
pronounced like rolling, her name when her first Harry Potter book was
published was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of
young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers
demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she had no
middle name, she chose K as the second initial of her pen name, from her
paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls herself Jo and has
said, ""No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was young, unless they were
angry."" Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray
when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave
evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling. In a 2012 interview,
Rowling noted that she no longer cared that people pronounced her name
incorrectly.Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft
engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate,
Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her mother
Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on a train
departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married
on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather, Dugald Campbell, was born
in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis
Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending
the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War.Rowling's sister
Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old. The family moved
to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four. She attended St
Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce
and education reformer Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred
Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster
Albus Dumbledore.As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she
would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: ""I can still remember
me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed
strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever
wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got
the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss
Bee."" At the age of nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the
Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a
young teenager, her great aunt, who Rowling said ""taught classics and approved
of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind,"" gave her a very old
copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels. Mitford became
Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.Rowling has
said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New Yorker, ""I wasn’t
particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of life."" She had a difficult
homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her
father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him). She attended secondary
school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother had worked as a
technician in the science department. Rowling said of her adolescence,
""Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all Harry Potter character] is loosely based on

**Born:** December 16, 1775 in Steventon Rectory, Hampshire, The United
Kingdom

**Description:**

Jane Austen was an English novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among
the landed gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers
in English literature, her realism and biting social commentary cementing her
historical importance among scholars and critics.Austen lived her entire life
as part of a close-knit family located on the lower fringes of the English
landed gentry. She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as
well as through her own reading. The steadfast support of her family was
critical to her development as a professional writer. Her artistic
apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about 35 years old.
During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including
the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and wrote and extensively
revised three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1816, with the
release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield
Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She
wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published
posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled Sanditon,
but died before completing it.Austen's works critique the novels of
sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the
transition to 19th-century realism. Her plots, though fundamentally comic,
highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and
economic security. Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few
positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her
nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her to a wider public, and by the

    <p><strong>Born:</strong> <span class=""author-born-date"">December 16, 1775</span> <span class=""author-born-location"">in Steventon Rectory, Hampshire, The United Kingdom</span></p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p class=""author-description"">
        Jane Austen was an English novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among the landed gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers in English literature, her realism and biting social commentary cementing her historical importance among scholars and critics.Austen lived her entire life as part of a close-knit family located on the lower fringes of the English landed gentry. She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. The steadfast support of her family was critical to her development as a professional writer. Her artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about 35 years old. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1816, with the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled Sanditon, but died before completing it.Austen's works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become widely accepted in academia as a great English writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a Janeite fan culture.

**Born:** June 01, 1926 in The United States

**Description:**

Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 – August 5, 1962) was
an American actress, model, and singer, who became a major sex symbol,
starring in a number of commercially successful motion pictures during the
1950s and early 1960s.After spending much of her childhood in foster homes,
Monroe began a career as a model, which led to a film contract in 1946 with
Twentieth Century-Fox. Her early film appearances were minor, but her
performances in The Asphalt Jungle and All About Eve (both 1950), drew
attention. By 1952 she had her first leading role in Don't Bother to Knock and
1953 brought a lead in Niagara, a melodramatic film noir that dwelt on her
seductiveness. Her ""dumb blonde"" persona was used to comic effect in
subsequent films such as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), How to Marry a
Millionaire (1953) and The Seven Year Itch (1955). Limited by typecasting,
Monroe studied at the Actors Studio to broaden her range. Her dramatic
performance in Bus Stop (1956) was hailed by critics and garnered a Golden
Globe nomination. Her production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, released
The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), for which she received a BAFTA Award
nomination and won a David di Donatello award. She received a Golden Globe
Award for her performance in Some Like It Hot (1959). Monroe's last completed
film was The Misfits, co-starring Clark Gable with screenplay by her then-
husband, Arthur Miller.Marilyn was a passionate reader, owning four hundred
books at the time of her death, and was often photographed with a book.The
final years of Monroe's life were marked by illness, personal problems, and a
reputation for unreliability and being difficult to work with. The
circumstances of her death, from an overdose of barbiturates, have been the
subject of conjecture. Though officially classified as a ""probable suicide"",
the possibility of an accidental overdose, as well as of homicide, have not
been ruled out. In 1999, Monroe was ranked as the sixth greatest female star
of all time by the American Film Institute. In the decades following her
death, she has often been cited as both a pop and a cultural icon as well as
the quintessential American sex symbol.","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

industrial research laboratory.Edison is considered one of the most prolific
inventors in history, holding 1,093 U.S. patents in his name, as well as many
patents in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. He is credited with
numerous inventions that contributed to mass communication and, in particular,
telecommunications. His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his
early career as a telegraph operator. Edison originated the concept and

**Born:** April 24, 1899 in The United States

**Description:**

Allen Saunders was an American writer, journalist and cartoonist who wrote the
comic strips Steve Roper and Mike Nomad, Mary Worth and Kerry Drake. His full
name, John Allen Saunders, sometimes led to confusion with his son John (John
Phillip Saunders, 1924–2003), who later continued two of his father's
strips.Born in Lebanon, Indiana, Saunders enjoyed newspaper comics as a youth,
and he practiced drawing them. After graduating from Wabash College in 1920,
he taught French there for seven years while working in the summers on his
M.A. at the University of Chicago and taking night classes at the Chicago
Academy of Fine Arts. He drew editorial cartoons and the single-panel
Miserable Moments, wrote detective fiction for magazines, worked in Chautauqua
theater and wrote plays. These experiences converged in his later comics
career.[2]In 1927, while on sabbatical from Wabash, he moved to Toledo, Ohio
as a reporter and drama critic for the News-Bee, and he stayed on with that
newspaper. Eight years later, Elmer Woggon (a friend at the rival Toledo
Blade) proposed a comic strip for Publishers Syndicate (later Publishers-Hall
Syndicate), The Great Gusto, which he would draw if Saunders did the writing.
They shook on it, but it wasn't accepted until they refocused on its Indian
character. On November 23, 1936, it finally appeared in the newspapers as Big
Chief Wahoo and scored a success—fortunately, as Saunders' regular job ended
when the News-Bee folded in 1938. Gags gave way to adventure strips, so in
1940, he began to reshape the narrative into Steve Roper, centered on the
escapades of a racket-busting photojournalist","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

**Born:** March 02, 1904 in Springfield, MA, The United States

**Description:**

Theodor Seuss Geisel was born 2 March 1904 in Springfield, MA. He graduated
Dartmouth College in 1925, and proceeded on to Oxford University with the
intent of acquiring a doctorate in literature. At Oxford he met Helen Palmer,
who he wed in 1927. He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a
magazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time,
submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. Additionally, he was
submitting cartoons to Life, Vanity Fair and Liberty. In some of his works,
he'd made reference to an insecticide called Flit. These references gained
notice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for Flit. This association
lasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase
""Quick, Henry, the Flit!"" In 1936 on the way to a vaction in Europe, listening
to the rhythm of the ship's engines, he came up with And to Think That I Saw
It on Mulberry Street, which was then promptly rejected by the first 43
publishers he showed it to. Eventually in 1937 a friend published the book for
him, and it went on to at least moderate success. During WW II, Geisel joined
the army and was sent to Hollywood. Captain Geisel would write for Frank
Capra's Signal Corps Unit (for which he won the Legion of Merit) and do
documentaries (he won Oscar's for Hitler Lives and Design for Death). He also
created a cartoon called Gerald McBoing-Boing which also won him an Oscar. In
May of 1954, Life published a report concerning illiteracy among school
children. The report said, among other things, that children were having
trouble to read because their books were boring. This inspired Geisel's
publisher, and prompted him to send Geisel a list of 400 words he felt were
important, asked him to cut the list to 250 words (the publishers idea of how
many words at one time a first grader could absorb), and write a book. Nine
months later, Geisel, using 220 of the words given to him published The Cat in
the Hat, which went on to instant success. In 1960 Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50
that he couldn't write an entire book using only fifty words. The result was
Green Eggs and Ham. Cerf never paid the $50 from the bet. Helen Palmer Geisel
died in 1967. Theodor Geisel married Audrey Stone Diamond in 1968. Theodor
Seuss Geisel died 24 September 1991. Also worked under the pen name:Theo Le

**Born:** October 15, 1844 in Röcken bei Lützen, Prussian Province of Saxony,
Germany

**Description:**

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844–1900) is a German philosopher of the late
19th century who challenged the foundations of Christianity and traditional
morality. He was interested in the enhancement of individual and cultural
health, and believed in life, creativity, power, and the realities of the
world we live in, rather than those situated in a world beyond. Central to his
philosophy is the idea of “life-affirmation,” which involves an honest
questioning of all doctrines that drain life's expansive energies, however
socially prevalent those views might be. Often referred to as one of the first
existentialist philosophers along with Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855),
Nietzsche's revitalizing philosophy has inspired leading figures in all walks
of cultural life, including dancers, poets, novelists, painters,
psychologists, philosophers, sociologists and social revolutionaries.From the

**Born:** November 30, 1835 in Florida, Missouri, The United States

**Description:**

Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an
American author and humorist. He is noted for his novels Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn (1885), called ""the Great American Novel"", and The Adventures
of Tom Sawyer (1876).Twain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which would later
provide the setting for Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. He apprenticed with a
printer. He also worked as a typesetter and contributed articles to his older
brother Orion's newspaper. After toiling as a printer in various cities, he
became a master riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River, before heading west
to join Orion. He was a failure at gold mining, so he next turned to
journalism. While a reporter, he wrote a humorous story, ""The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,"" which proved to be very popular and brought
him nationwide attention. His travelogues were also well-received. Twain had
found his calling.He achieved great success as a writer and public speaker.
His wit and satire earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend
to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty.However, he
lacked financial acumen. Though he made a great deal of money from his
writings and lectures, he squandered it on various ventures, in particular the
Paige Compositor, and was forced to declare bankruptcy. With the help of Henry
Huttleston Rogers, however, he eventually overcame his financial troubles.
Twain worked hard to ensure that all of his creditors were paid in full, even
though his bankruptcy had relieved him of the legal responsibility.Born during
a visit by Halley's Comet, he died on its return. He was lauded as the
""greatest American humorist of his age"", and William Faulkner called Twain
""the father of American literature"".Excerpted from Wikipedia.","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

**Born:** August 07, 1942 in Anoka, Minnesota, The United States

**Description:**

Garrison Keillor (born Gary Edward Keillor on August 7, 1942 in Anoka,
Minnesota) is an American author, storyteller, humorist, columnist, musician,
satirist, and radio personality. He is known as host of the Minnesota Public
Radio show ""A Prairie Home Companion"".Keillor was born in Anoka, Minnesota,
the son of Grace Ruth (née Denham) and John Philip Keillor, who was a
carpenter and postal worker. His father had English ancestry, partly by way of
Canada (Keillor's paternal grandfather was from Kingston, Ontario). His
maternal grandparents were Scottish immigrants, from Glasgow. The family
belonged to the Plymouth Brethren, a fundamentalist Christian denomination
Keillor has since left. He is six feet, three inches (1.9 m) tall. Keillor is
a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. In 2006 he told Christianity
Today that he was attending the Episcopal church in Saint Paul, after
previously attending a Lutheran church in New York.Keillor graduated from
Anoka High School in 1960 and from the University of Minnesota with a
bachelor's degree in English in 1966. During college, he began his
broadcasting career on the student-operated radio station known today as Radio
K.Keillor has been married three times.Garrison Keillor started his
professional radio career in November 1969 with Minnesota Educational Radio,
now Minnesota Public Radio. He hosted The Morning Program on weekdays from 6
to 9 a.m. on KSJR 90.1 FM at St. John's University, which the station called
""A Prairie Home Entertainment."" The show's eclectic music was a major
divergence from the station's usual classical fare. During this time he also
began submitting fiction to The New Yorker, where his first story, ""Local
Family Keeps Son Happy,"" appeared on September 19, 1970.Keillor resigned from
The Morning Program in February 1971 to protest a perceived attempt to
interfere with his musical programming. The show became A Prairie Home
Companion when he returned in October.A Prairie Home Companion debuted as an
old-style variety show before a live audience on July 6, 1974, featuring guest
musicians and a cadre cast doing musical numbers and comic skits replete with
elaborate live sound effects. The show was punctuated by spoof commercial
spots from fictitious sponsors such as Powdermilk Biscuits. The show also
contains parodic serial melodramas, such as The Adventures of Guy Noir,
Private Eye and The Lives of the Cowboys. Keillor voices Noir and other
recurring characters, and also provides vocals for some of the show's musical
numbers.A Prairie Home Companion ran until 1987, when Keillor decided to end
it to focus on other projects. In 1989, he launched another live radio program
from New York City, ""The American Radio Company of the Air"" — which had almost
the same format as A Prairie Home Companion's. In 1992, he moved ARC back to
St. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to A Prairie Home Companion;
it has remained a Saturday night fixture ever since.Keillor has been called
""[o]ne of the most perceptive and witty commentators about Midwestern life"" by
Randall Balmer in Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism. He has written numerous
magazine and newspaper articles and more than a dozen books for adults as well
as children. He has also written for Salon.com and authored an advice column
at Salon.com under the name ""Mr. Blue.""In 2004 Keillor published a collection
of political essays, Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart
of America, and in June 2005 he began a column called ""The Old Scout"", which
ran at Salon.com and in syndicated newspapers. The column went on hiatus in
April 2010.Keillor wrote the screenplay for the 2006 movie A Prairie Home
Companion, directed by Robert Altman. (Keillor also appears in the movie.)","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

**Born:** July 12, 1904 in Parral, Chile

**Description:**

Pablo Neruda was the pen name and, later, legal name of the Chilean writer and
politician Neftalí Ricardo Reyes Basoalto. Neruda assumed his pen name as a
teenager, partly because it was in vogue, partly to hide his poetry from his
father, a rigid man who wanted his son to have a ""practical"" occupation.
Neruda's pen name was derived from Czech writer and poet Jan Neruda; Pablo is
thought to be from Paul Verlaine. With his works translated into many
languages, Pablo Neruda is considered one of the greatest and most influential
poets of the 20th century.Neruda was accomplished in a variety of styles
ranging from erotically charged love poems like his collection Twenty Poems of
Love and a Song of Despair, surrealist poems, historical epics, and overtly
political manifestos. In 1971 Neruda won the Nobel Prize for Literature, a
controversial award because of his political activism. Colombian novelist
Gabriel García Márquez once called him ""the greatest poet of the 20th century
in any language.""On July 15, 1945, at Pacaembu Stadium in São Paulo, Brazil,
he read to 100,000 people in honor of Communist revolutionary leader Luís
Carlos Prestes. When Neruda returned to Chile after his Nobel Prize acceptance
speech, Salvador Allende invited him to read at the Estadio Nacional before
70,000 people.During his lifetime, Neruda occupied many diplomatic posts and
served a stint as a senator for the Chilean Communist Party. When Conservative
Chilean President González Videla outlawed communism in Chile, a warrant was
issued for Neruda's arrest. Friends hid him for months in a house basement in
the Chilean port of Valparaíso. Later, Neruda escaped into exile through a
mountain pass near Maihue Lake into Argentina. Years later, Neruda was a close
collaborator to socialist President Salvador Allende.Neruda was hospitalized
with cancer at the time of the Chilean coup d'état led by Augusto Pinochet.
Three days after being hospitalized, Neruda died of heart failure. Already a
legend in life, Neruda's death reverberated around the world. Pinochet had
denied permission to transform Neruda's funeral into a public event. However,
thousands of grieving Chileans disobeyed the curfew and crowded the streets.
Neruda's funeral became the first public protest against the Chilean military
dictatorship.","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

**Born:** May 25, 1803 in Boston, Massachusetts, The United States

**Description:**

in 1803, Ralph Waldo Emerson was born in Boston. Educated at Harvard and the
Cambridge Divinity School, he became a Unitarian minister in 1826 at the
Second Church Unitarian. The congregation, with Christian overtones, issued
communion, something Emerson refused to do. ""Really, it is beyond my
comprehension,"" Emerson once said, when asked by a seminary professor whether
he believed in God. (Quoted in 2,000 Years of Freethought edited by Jim
Haught.) By 1832, after the untimely death of his first wife, Emerson cut
loose from Unitarianism. During a year-long trip to Europe, Emerson became
acquainted with such intelligentsia as British writer Thomas Carlyle, and
poets Wordsworth and Coleridge. He returned to the United States in 1833, to a
life as poet, writer and lecturer. Emerson inspired Transcendentalism,
although never adopting the label himself. He rejected traditional ideas of
deity in favor of an ""Over-Soul"" or ""Form of Good,"" ideas which were
considered highly heretical. His books include Nature (1836), The American
Scholar (1837), Divinity School Address (1838), Essays, 2 vol. (1841, 1844),
Nature, Addresses and Lectures (1849), and three volumes of poetry. Margaret
Fuller became one of his ""disciples,"" as did Henry David Thoreau.The best of
Emerson's rather wordy writing survives as epigrams, such as the famous: ""A
foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little
statesmen and philosophers and divines."" Other one- (and two-) liners include:
""As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of
the intellect"" (Self-Reliance, 1841). ""The most tedious of all discourses are
on the subject of the Supreme Being"" (Journal, 1836). ""The word miracle, as
pronounced by Christian churches, gives a false impression; it is a monster.
It is not one with the blowing clover and the falling rain"" (Address to
Harvard Divinity College, July 15, 1838). He demolished the right wing
hypocrites of his era in his essay ""Worship"": "". . . the louder he talked of
his honor, the faster we counted our spoons"" (Conduct of Life, 1860). ""I hate
this shallow Americanism which hopes to get rich by credit, to get knowledge
by raps on midnight tables, to learn the economy of the mind by phrenology, or
skill without study, or mastery without apprenticeship"" (Self-Reliance). ""The
first and last lesson of religion is, 'The things that are seen are temporal;
the things that are not seen are eternal.' It puts an affront upon nature""
(English Traits , 1856). ""The god of the cannibals will be a cannibal, of the
crusaders a crusader, and of the merchants a merchant."" (Civilization, 1862).
He influenced generations of Americans, from his friend Henry David Thoreau to
John Dewey, and in Europe, Friedrich Nietzsche, who takes up such Emersonian
themes as power, fate, the uses of poetry and history, and the critique of
Christianity. D. 1882.More:

**Born:** November 26, 1922 in Minneapolis, MN, The United States

**Description:**

Charles Monroe Schulz was an American cartoonist, whose comic strip Peanuts
proved one of the most popular and influential in the history of the medium,
and is still widely reprinted on a daily basis.Schulz's first regular
cartoons, Li'l Folks, were published from 1947 to 1950 by the St. Paul Pioneer
Press; he first used the name Charlie Brown for a character there, although he
applied the name in four gags to three different boys and one buried in sand.
The series also had a dog that looked much like Snoopy. In 1948, Schulz sold a
cartoon to The Saturday Evening Post; the first of 17 single-panel cartoons by
Schulz that would be published there. In 1948, Schulz tried to have Li'l Folks
syndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association. Schulz would have
been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but
the deal fell through. Li'l Folks was dropped from the Pioneer Press in
January, 1950.Later that year, Schulz approached the United Feature Syndicate
with his best strips from Li'l Folks, and Peanuts made its first appearance on
October 2, 1950. The strip became one of the most popular comic strips of all
time. He also had a short-lived sports-oriented comic strip called It's Only a
Game (1957–1959), but he abandoned it due to the demands of the successful
Peanuts. From 1956 to 1965 he contributed a single-panel strip (""Young
Pillars"") featuring teenagers to Youth, a publication associated with the
Church of God.Peanuts ran for nearly 50 years, almost without interruption;
during the life of the strip, Schulz took only one vacation, a five-week break
in late 1997. At its peak, Peanuts appeared in more than 2,600 newspapers in
75 countries. Schulz stated that his routine every morning consisted of eating
a jelly donut and sitting down to write the day's strip. After coming up with
an idea (which he said could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours),
he began drawing it, which took about an hour for dailies and three hours for
Sunday strips. He stubbornly refused to hire an inker or letterer, saying that
""it would be equivalent to a golfer hiring a man to make his putts for him.""
In November 1999 Schulz suffered a stroke, and later it was discovered that he
had colon cancer that had metastasized. Because of the chemotherapy and the
fact he could not read or see clearly, he announced his retirement on December
14, 1999. Schulz often touched on religious themes in his work, including the
classic television cartoon, A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965), which features
the character Linus van Pelt quoting the King James Version of the Bible Luke
2:8-14 to explain ""what Christmas is all about."" In personal interviews Schulz
mentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side. Schulz, reared in the
Lutheran faith, had been active in the Church of God as a young adult and then
later taught Sunday school at a United Methodist Church. In the 1960s, Robert
L. Short interpreted certain themes and conversations in Peanuts as being
consistent with parts of Christian theology, and used them as illustrations
during his lectures about the gospel, as he explained in his bestselling
paperback book, The Gospel According to Peanuts, the first of several books he
wrote on religion and Peanuts, and other popular culture items.From the late
1980s, however, Schulz described himself in interviews as a ""secular
humanist"": “I do not go to church anymore... I guess you might say I've come
around to secular humanism, an obligation I believe all humans have to others
and the world we live in.”","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

**Born:** November 22, 1819 in South Farm, Arbury Hall, Nuneaton,
Warwickshire, The United Kingdom

**Description:**

In 1819, novelist George Eliot (nee Mary Ann Evans), was born at a farmstead
in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, where her father was estate manager. Mary
Ann, the youngest child and a favorite of her father's, received a good
education for a young woman of her day. Influenced by a favorite governess,
she became a religious evangelical as an adolescent. Her first published work
was a religious poem. Through a family friend, she was exposed to Charles
Hennell's An Inquiry into the Origins of Christianity. Unable to believe, she
conscientiously gave up religion and stopped attending church. Her father
shunned her, sending the broken-hearted young dependent to live with a sister
until she promised to reexamine her feelings. Her intellectual views did not,
however, change. She translated David Strauss' Das Leben Jesu, a monumental
task, without signing her name to the 1846 work. After her father's death in
1849, Mary Ann traveled, then accepted an unpaid position with The Westminster
Review. Despite a heavy workload, she translated Ludwig Feuerbach's The
Essence of Christianity, the only book ever published under her real name.
That year, the shy, respectable writer scandalized British society by sending
notices to friends announcing she had entered a free ""union"" with George Henry
Lewes, editor of The Leader, who was unable to divorce his first wife. They
lived harmoniously together for the next 24 years, but suffered social
ostracism and financial hardship. She became salaried and began writing essays
and reviews for The Westminster Review. Renaming herself ""Marian"" in private
life and adopting the nom de plume ""George Eliot,"" she began her impressive
fiction career, including: Adam Bede (1859), The Mill on the Floss (1860),
Silas Marner (1861), Romola (1863), and Middlemarch (1871). Themes included
her humanist vision and strong heroines. Her poem, ""O May I Join the Choir
Invisible"" expressed her views about non supernatural immortality: ""O may I
join the choir invisible/ Of those immortal dead who live again/ In minds made
better by their presence. . ."" D. 1880.Her 1872 work Middlemarch has been
described by Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the
English language.More:

**Born:** August 02, 1924 in Harlem, New York, The United States

**Description:**

Librarian Note: There is more than one author in the GoodReads database with
this name. See this thread for more information.James Arthur Baldwin was an
American novelist, essayist, playwright, poet, and social critic.James Baldwin
offered a vital literary voice during the era of civil rights activism in the
1950s and '60s. The eldest of nine children, his stepfather was a minister. At
age 14, Baldwin became a preacher at the small Fireside Pentecostal Church in
Harlem. In the early 1940s, he transferred his faith from religion to
literature. Critics, however, note the impassioned cadences of Black churches
are still evident in his writing. Go Tell It on the Mountain, his first novel,
is a partially autobiographical account of his youth. His essay collections
Notes of a Native Son, Nobody Knows My Name, and The Fire Next Time were
influential in informing a large white audience.From 1948, Baldwin made his
home primarily in the south of France, but often returned to the USA to
lecture or teach. In 1957, he began spending half of each year in New York
City. His novels include Giovanni's Room, about a white American expatriate
who must come to terms with his homosexuality, and Another Country, about
racial and gay sexual tensions among New York intellectuals. His inclusion of
gay themes resulted in a lot of savage criticism from the Black community.
Eldridge Cleaver, of the Black Panthers, stated the Baldwin's writing
displayed an ""agonizing, total hatred of blacks."" Baldwin's play, Blues for
Mister Charlie, was produced in 1964. Going to Meet the Man and Tell Me How
Long the Train's Been Gone provided powerful descriptions of American racism.
As an openly gay man, he became increasingly outspoken in condemning
discrimination against lesbian and gay people.On November 30, 1987 Baldwin
died from stomach cancer in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France.He was buried at the

**Born:** July 27, 1824 in Paris, France

**Description:**

Alexandre Dumas (son) was born in Paris, France, the illegitimate child of
Marie-Laure-Catherine Labay (1794-1868), a dressmaker, and novelist Alexandre
Dumas. During 1831 his father legally recognized him and ensured that the
young Dumas received the best education possible at the Institution Goubaux
and the Collège Bourbon. At that time, the law allowed the elder Dumas to take
the child away from his mother. Her agony inspired Dumas fils to write about
tragic female characters. In almost all of his writings, he emphasized the
moral purpose of literature and in his play The Illegitimate Son (1858) he
espoused the belief that if a man fathers an illegitimate child then he has an
obligation to legitimize the child and marry the woman.Dumas' paternal great-
grandparents were a French nobleman and a Haitian woman. In boarding schools,
Dumas fils was constantly taunted by his classmates. These issues all
profoundly influenced his thoughts, behaviour, and writing.During 1844 Dumas
moved to Saint-Germain-en-Laye to live with his father. There, he met Marie
Duplessis, a young courtesan who would be the inspiration for his romantic
novel The Lady of the Camellias. Adapted into a play, it was titled in English
(especially in the United States) as Camille and is the basis for Verdi's 1853
opera, La Traviata. Although he admitted that he had done the adaptation
because he needed the money, he had a great success with the play. Thus began
the career of Dumas fils as a dramatist, which was not only more renowned than
that of his father during his lifetime but also dominated the serious French
stage for most of the second half of the 19th century. After this, he
virtually abandoned writing novels (though his semi-autobiographical L'Affaire
Clemenceau (1867) achieved some success).On 31 December 1864, in Moscow, Dumas
married Nadjeschda von Knorring (1826 – April 1895), daughter of Johan
Reinhold von Knorring and wife, and widow of Alexander, Prince Naryschkine.
The couple had two daughters: Marie-Alexandrine-Henriette Dumas, born 20
November 1860, who married Maurice Lippmann and was the mother of Serge
Napoléon Lippmann (1886–1975) and Auguste Alexandre Lippmann (1881–1960); and
Jeanine Dumas (3 May 1867–), who married Ernest d' Hauterive (1864–1957), son
of George Lecourt d' Hauterive and wife (married in 1861) Léontine de Leusse.
After Naryschkine's death, he married in June 1895 Henriette Régnier de La
Brière (1851–1934), without issue.During 1874, he was admitted to the Académie
française, and in 1894 he was awarded the Légion d'honneur.Alexandre Dumas
fils died at Marly-le-Roi, Yvelines, on November 27, 1895 and was interred in
the Cimetière de Montmartre in Paris. His grave is, perhaps coincidentally,
only some 100 metres away from that of Marie Duplessis.","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American author and journalist. His economical
and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while
his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations.
Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s,
and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six
short story collections and two non-fiction works. Three novels, four
collections of short stories and three non-fiction works were published
posthumously. Many of these are considered classics of American
literature.Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school he
reported for a few months for The Kansas City Star, before leaving for the
Italian front to enlist with the World War I ambulance drivers. In 1918, he
was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the
basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms. In 1922, he married Hadley Richardson,
the first of his four wives. The couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a
foreign correspondent, and fell under the influence of the modernist writers
and artists of the 1920s ""Lost Generation"" expatriate community. The Sun Also
Rises, Hemingway's first novel, was published in 1926.After his 1927 divorce
from Hadley Richardson, Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer. They divorced
after he returned from Spanish Civil War where he had acted as a journalist,
and after which he wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls. Martha Gellhorn became his
third wife in 1940. They separated when he met Mary Welsh in London during
World War II; during which he was present at the Normandy Landings and
liberation of Paris.Shortly after the publication of The Old Man and the Sea
in 1952, Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in two
plane crashes that left him in pain or ill-health for much of the rest of his
life. Hemingway had permanent residences in Key West, Florida, and Cuba during
the 1930s and 1940s, but in 1959 he moved from Cuba to Ketchum, Idaho, where
he committed suicide in the summer of 1961.","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.

**Born:** July 26, 1856 in Dublin, Ireland

**Description:**

George Bernard Shaw was an Irish playwright, socialist, and a co-founder of
the London School of Economics. Although his first profitable writing was
music and literary criticism, in which capacity he wrote many highly
articulate pieces of journalism, his main talent was for drama. Over the
course of his life he wrote more than 60 plays. Nearly all his plays address
prevailing social problems, but each also includes a vein of comedy that makes
their stark themes more palatable. In these works Shaw examined education,
marriage, religion, government, health care, and class privilege.An ardent
socialist, Shaw was angered by what he perceived to be the exploitation of the
working class. He wrote many brochures and speeches for the Fabian Society. He
became an accomplished orator in the furtherance of its causes, which included
gaining equal rights for men and women, alleviating abuses of the working
class, rescinding private ownership of productive land, and promoting healthy
lifestyles. For a short time he was active in local politics, serving on the
London County Council.In 1898, Shaw married Charlotte Payne-Townshend, a
fellow Fabian, whom he survived. They settled in Ayot St. Lawrence in a house
now called Shaw's Corner. He is the only person to have been awarded both a
Nobel Prize for Literature (1925) and an Oscar (1938). The former for his
contributions to literature and the latter for his work on the film
""Pygmalion"" (adaptation of his play of the same name). Shaw wanted to refuse
his Nobel Prize outright, as he had no desire for public honours, but he
accepted it at his wife's behest. She considered it a tribute to Ireland. He
did reject the monetary award, requesting it be used to finance translation of
Swedish books to English.Shaw died at Shaw's Corner, aged 94, from chronic
health problems exacerbated by injuries incurred by falling.","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

and translator. His work has been described as 'easily accessible, yet
profoundly complex'. He can be located on Facebook at:
https://www.facebook.com/harukimuraka...Since childhood, Murakami has been
heavily influenced by Western culture, particularly Western music and

Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan, and he is often distinguished from other
Japanese writers by his Western influences.Murakami studied drama at Waseda
University in Tokyo, where he met his wife, Yoko. His first job was at a
record store, which is where one of his main characters, Toru Watanabe in
Norwegian Wood, works. Shortly before finishing his studies, Murakami opened
the coffeehouse 'Peter Cat' which was a jazz bar in the evening in Kokubunji,
Tokyo with his wife.Many of his novels have themes and titles that invoke
classical music, such as the three books making up The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle:
The Thieving Magpie (after Rossini's opera), Bird as Prophet (after a piano
piece by Robert Schumann usually known in English as The Prophet Bird), and
The Bird-Catcher (a character in Mozart's opera The Magic Flute). Some of his
novels take their titles from songs: Dance, Dance, Dance (after The Dells'
song, although it is widely thought it was titled after the Beach Boys tune),
Norwegian Wood (after The Beatles' song) and South of the Border, West of the
Sun (the first part being the title of a song by Nat King Cole).","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

**Born:** June 27, 1880 in Tuscumbia, Alabama, The United States

**Description:**

Helen Keller would not be bound by conditions. Rendered deaf and blind at 19
months by scarlet fever, she learned to read (in several languages) and even
speak, eventually graduating with honors from Radcliffe College in 1904, where
as a student she wrote The Story of My Life. That she accomplished all of this
in an age when few women attended college and the disabled were often
relegated to the background, spoken of only in hushed tones, is remarkable.
But Keller's many other achievements are impressive by any standard: she
authored 13 books, wrote countless articles, and devoted her life to social
reform. An active and effective suffragist, pacifist, and socialist (the
latter association earned her an FBI file), she lectured on behalf of disabled
people everywhere. She also helped start several foundations that continue to
improve the lives of the deaf and blind around the world. As a young girl
Keller was obstinate, prone to fits of violence, and seething with rage at her
inability to express herself. But at the age of 7 this wild child was
transformed when, at the urging of Alexander Graham Bell, Anne Sullivan became
her teacher, an event she declares ""the most important day I remember in all
my life."" (Sullivan herself had once been blind, but partially recovered her
sight after a series of operations.) In a memorable passage, Keller writes of
the day ""Teacher"" led her to a stream and repeatedly spelled out the letters
w-a-t-e-r on one of her hands while pouring water over the other. This method
proved a revelation: ""That living world awakened my soul, gave it light, hope,
joy, set it free! There were barriers still, it is true, but barriers that
could in time be swept away."" And, indeed, most of them were. In her lovingly
crafted and deeply perceptive autobiography, Keller's joyous spirit is most
vividly expressed in her connection to nature: Indeed, everything that could
hum, or buzz, or sing, or bloom, had a part in my education.... Few know what
joy it is to feel the roses pressing softly into the hand, or the beautiful
motion of the lilies as they sway in the morning breeze. Sometimes I caught an
insect in the flower I was plucking, and I felt the faint noise of a pair of
wings rubbed together in a sudden terror.... The idea of feeling rather than
hearing a sound, or of admiring a flower's motion rather than its color,
evokes a strong visceral sensation in the reader, giving The Story of My Life
a subtle power and beauty. Keller's celebration of discovery becomes our own.
In the end, this blind and deaf woman succeeds in sharpening our eyes and ears
to the beauty of the world. --Shawn Carkonen","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

**Description:**

I was born in Connecticut in 1973, during a brief blip in my family's
otherwise western U.S. existence. We were settled in Phoenix by the time I was
four, and I think of myself as a native. The unusual spelling of my name was a
gift from my father, Stephen (+ ie = me). Though I have had my name spelled
wrong on pretty much everything my entire life long, I must admit that it
makes it easier to google myself now.I filled the ""Jan Brady"" spot in my
family-the second of three girls. Unlike the Brady's, none of my three
brothers are steps, and all of them are younger than all the girls. I went to
high school in Scottsdale, Arizona, the kind of place where every fall a few
girls would come back to school with new noses and there were Porsches in the
student lot (for the record, I have my original nose, and never had a car
until after I was in my twenties). I was awarded a National Merit Scholarship,
and I used it to pay my way to Brigham Young University, in Provo, Utah. I
majored in English, but concentrated on literature rather than creative
writing, mostly because I didn't consider reading books ""work"" (as long as I
was going to be doing something anyway, I might as well get course credit for
it, right?).I met my husband, Pancho (his real name is Christiaan), when I was
four, but we were never anywhere close to being childhood sweethearts. In
fact, though we saw each other at least weekly through church activities, I
can't recall a single instance when we so much as greeted each other with a
friendly wave, let alone exchanged actual words. This may have been for the
best, because when we did eventually get around to exchanging words, sixteen
years after our first meeting, it only took nine months from the first ""hello""
to the wedding. Of course, we were able to skip over a lot of the getting to
know you parts (many of our conversations would go something like this: ""This
one time, when I was ten, I broke my hand at a party when-"" ""Yeah, I know what
happened. I was there, remember?"") We've been married for ten and a half years
now, and have three beautiful, brilliant, wonderful boys who often remind me
chimpanzees on crack. I can't write without music, and my biggest muse is,
ironically enough, the band Muse. My other favorite sources of inspiration are
Linkin Park, My Chemical Romance, Coldplay, The All American Rejects, Travis,
The Strokes, Brand New, U2, Kasabian, Jimmy Eat World, and Weezer, to mention

**Born:** August 16, 1920 in Andernach, Germany

**Description:**

Henry Charles Bukowski (born as Heinrich Karl Bukowski) was a German-born
American poet, novelist and short story writer. His writing was influenced by
the social, cultural and economic ambience of his home city of Los Angeles.It
is marked by an emphasis on the ordinary lives of poor Americans, the act of
writing, alcohol, relationships with women and the drudgery of work. Bukowski
wrote thousands of poems, hundreds of short stories and six novels, eventually
publishing over sixty booksCharles Bukowski was the only child of an American
soldier and a German mother. At the age of three, he came with his family to
the United States and grew up in Los Angeles. He attended Los Angeles City
College from 1939 to 1941, then left school and moved to New York City to
become a writer. His lack of publishing success at this time caused him to
give up writing in 1946 and spurred a ten-year stint of heavy drinking. After
he developed a bleeding ulcer, he decided to take up writing again. He worked
a wide range of jobs to support his writing, including dishwasher, truck
driver and loader, mail carrier, guard, gas station attendant, stock boy,
warehouse worker, shipping clerk, post office clerk, parking lot attendant,
Red Cross orderly, and elevator operator. He also worked in a dog biscuit
factory, a slaughterhouse, a cake and cookie factory, and he hung posters in
New York City subways.Bukowski published his first story when he was twenty-
four and began writing poetry at the age of thirty-five. His first book of
poetry was published in 1959; he went on to publish more than forty-five books
of poetry and prose, including Pulp (1994), Screams from the Balcony (1993),
and The Last Night of the Earth Poems (1992).He died of leukemia in San Pedro

**Born:** January 03, 1892 in Bloemfontein, Mangaung, Free State, South Africa

**Description:**

John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, CBE, was an English writer, poet, WWI veteran (a
First Lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army), philologist, and
university professor, best known as the author of the high fantasy classic
works The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings .Tolkien was Rawlinson and Bosworth
Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford from 1925 to 1945, and Merton Professor of
English language and literature from 1945 to 1959. He was a close friend of
C.S. Lewis.Christopher Tolkien published a series of works based on his
father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The
Silmarillion . These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form
a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and
literary essays about an imagined world called Arda, and Middle-earth within
it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the word ""legendarium"" to the
larger part of these writings. While many other authors had published works of
fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the
Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused
Tolkien to be popularly identified as the ""father"" of modern fantasy
literature—or more precisely, high fantasy. Tolkien's writings have inspired
many other works of fantasy and have had a lasting effect on the entire
field.In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of ""The 50 greatest
British writers since 1945"". Forbes ranked him the 5th top-earning dead
celebrity in 2009.Religious influencesJ.R.R. Tolkien, was born in South Africa
in 1892, but his family moved to Britain when he was about 3 years old. When
Tolkien was 8 years old, his mother converted to Catholicism, and he remained
a Catholic throughout his life. In his last interview, two years before his
death, he unhesitatingly testified, “I’m a devout Roman Catholic.” Tolkien
married his childhood sweetheart, Edith, and they had four children. He wrote
them letters each year as if from Santa Claus, and a selection of these was
published in 1976 as The Father Christmas Letters . One of Tolkien’s sons
became a Catholic priest. Tolkien was an advisor for the translation of the
Jerusalem Bible . Tolkien once described The Lord of the Rings to his friend
Robert Murray, an English Jesuit priest, as ""a fundamentally religious and
Catholic work, unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.""
There are many theological themes underlying the narrative including the
battle of good versus evil, the triumph of humility over pride, and the
activity of grace. In addition the saga includes themes which incorporate
death and immortality, mercy and pity, resurrection, salvation, repentance,
self-sacrifice, free will, justice, fellowship, authority and healing. In
addition The Lord's Prayer ""And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
from evil"" was reportedly present in Tolkien's mind as he described Frodo's
struggles against the power of the ""One Ring.''","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

television. She has worked on the staffs of several Nickelodeon shows,
including the Emmy-nominated hit Clarissa Explains it All and The Mystery
Files of Shelby Woo. For preschool viewers, she penned multiple stories for
the Emmy-nominated Little Bear and Oswald. She also co-wrote the critically
acclaimed Rankin/Bass Christmas special, Santa, Baby! Most recently she was
the Head Writer for Scholastic Entertainment’s Clifford’s Puppy Days.While
working on a Kids WB show called Generation O! she met children’s author James
Proimos, who talked her into giving children’s books a try.Thinking one day
about Alice in Wonderland, she was struck by how pastoral the setting must
seem to kids who, like her own, lived in urban surroundings. In New York City,
you’re much more likely to fall down a manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you
do, you’re not going to find a tea party. What you might find...? Well, that’s
the story of Gregor the Overlander, the first book in her five-part series,
The Underland Chronicles. Suzanne also has a rhyming picture book illustrated
by Mike Lester entitled When Charlie McButton Lost Power.She currently lives
in Connecticut with her family and a pair of feral kittens they adopted from

**Born:** August 06, 1809 in Somersby, Lincolnshire, The United Kingdom

**Description:**

Alfred Tennyson was born in Somersby, Lincolnshire, the fourth of the twelve
children of George Tennyson, clergyman, and his wife, Elizabeth. In 1816
Tennyson was sent to Louth Grammar School, which he disliked so intensely that
from 1820 he was educated at home until at the age of 18 he joined his two
brothers at Trinity College, Cambridge and with his brother Charles published
his first book, Poems by Two Brothers the same year. His second book, Poems
Chiefly Lyrical was published in 1830. In 1833, Tennyson's best friend Arthur
Henry Hallam, who was engaged to his sister, died, inspiring some of his best
work including In Memoriam, Ulysses and the Passing of Arthur.In 1850,
following William Wordsworth, Tennyson was appointed Poet Laureate and married
his childhood friend, Emily Sellwood. They had two children, Hallam born in
1852 and Lionel, two years later. In 1884, as a great favourite of both Queen
Victoria and Prince Albert, he was raised to the peerage and was thereafter
known as Baron Tennyson of Aldworth. He was the first Englishman to be granted
such a high rank solely for literary distinction. Tennyson continued to write
poetry throughout his life and in the 1870s also wrote a number of plays. he
died in 1892 at the age of 83 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.*Note. On
all books written by Tennyson, his name is written as Arthur Lord Tennyson,
and never Arthur Tennyson, and so his author's profile ought to be in this
name too.","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

**Born:** February 02, 1905 in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation

**Description:**

Alisa Rosenbaum was born in pre-revolutionary St. Petersburg to a prosperous
Jewish family. When the Bolsheviks requisitioned the pharmacy owned by her
father, Fronz, the Rosenbaums fled to the Crimea. Alisa returned to the city
(renamed Leningrad) to attend the university, but in 1926 relatives who had
already settled in America offered her the chance of joining them there. With
money from the sale of her mother's jewelry, Alisa bought a ticket to New
York. On arrival at Ellis Island, she changed into Ayn (after a name of some
Finnish author, probably ""Aino"") Rand (taken from the brand name of her
Remington-Rand typewriter). She moved swiftly to Hollywood, where she learned
English, worked in the RKO wardrobe department and as an extra, and wrote
through the night on screenplays and novels. She also married a bit-part actor
called Frank O'Connor because he was 'beautiful' - and because her original
visitor's visa had run out.Rand sold her first screenplay in 1932, but nobody
would buy her first novel We the Living (1936) a melodrama set in Russia. Her
first real success was The Fountainhead (rejected by more than ten publishers
before publication in 1943).She started a new philosophy known as Objectivism,
opposed to state interference of all kinds, and her follow-up novel Atlas
Shrugged (1957) describes a group who attempt to escape America's conspiracy
of mediocrity. Objectivism has been an influence on various other movements
such as Libertarianism, and Rand's vocal support for Laissez-faire Capitalism
and the free market has earned her a distinct spot among American
philosophers, and philosophers in general.---","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

**Born:** January 01, 1919 in Manhattan, New York, The United States

**Description:**

Jerome David Salinger was an American author, best known for his 1951 novel
The Catcher in the Rye, as well as his reclusive nature. His last original
published work was in 1965; he gave his last interview in 1980. Raised in
Manhattan, Salinger began writing short stories while in secondary school, and
published several stories in the early 1940s before serving in World War II.
In 1948 he published the critically acclaimed story ""A Perfect Day for
Bananafish"" in The New Yorker magazine, which became home to much of his
subsequent work. In 1951 Salinger released his novel The Catcher in the Rye,
an immediate popular success. His depiction of adolescent alienation and loss
of innocence in the protagonist Holden Caulfield was influential, especially
among adolescent readers. The novel remains widely read and controversial,
selling around 250,000 copies a year.The success of The Catcher in the Rye led
to public attention and scrutiny: Salinger became reclusive, publishing new
work less frequently. He followed Catcher with a short story collection, Nine
Stories (1953), a collection of a novella and a short story, Franny and Zooey
(1961), and a collection of two novellas, Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters
and Seymour: An Introduction (1963). His last published work, a novella
entitled ""Hapworth 16, 1924"", appeared in The New Yorker on June 19,
1965.Afterward, Salinger struggled with unwanted attention, including a legal
battle in the 1980s with biographer Ian Hamilton and the release in the late
1990s of memoirs written by two people close to him: Joyce Maynard, an ex-
lover; and Margaret Salinger, his daughter. In 1996, a small publisher
announced a deal with Salinger to publish ""Hapworth 16, 1924"" in book form,
but amid the ensuing publicity, the release was indefinitely delayed. He made
headlines around the globe in June 2009, after filing a lawsuit against
another writer for copyright infringement resulting from that writer's use of
one of Salinger's characters from The Catcher in the Rye. Salinger died of
natural causes on January 27, 2010, at his home in Cornish, New Hampshire.","<html><body><div><div class=""author-details"">

**Born:** October 14, 1894 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, The United States

**Description:**

Edward Estlin Cummings was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 14,
1894. He began writing poems as early as 1904 and studied Latin and Greek at
the Cambridge Latin High School.He received his BA in 1915 and his MA in 1916,
both from Harvard University. His studies there introduced him to the poetry
of avant-garde writers, such as Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound.In 1917,
Cummings published an early selection of poems in the anthology Eight Harvard
Poets. The same year, Cummings left the United States for France as a
volunteer ambulance driver in World War I. Five months after his assignment,
however, he and a friend were interned in a prison camp by the French
authorities on suspicion of espionage (an experience recounted in his novel,
The Enormous Room) for his outspoken anti-war convictions.After the war, he
settled into a life divided between houses in rural Connecticut and Greenwich
Village, with frequent visits to Paris. He also traveled throughout Europe,
meeting poets and artists, including Pablo Picasso, whose work he particularly
admired.In 1920, The Dial published seven poems by Cummings, including
""Buffalo Bill ’s.” Serving as Cummings’ debut to a wider American audience,
these “experiments” foreshadowed the synthetic cubist strategy Cummings would
explore in the next few years.In his work, Cummings experimented radically
with form, punctuation, spelling, and syntax, abandoning traditional
techniques and structures to create a new, highly idiosyncratic means of
poetic expression. Later in his career, he was often criticized for settling
into his signature style and not pressing his work toward further evolution.
Nevertheless, he attained great popularity, especially among young readers,
for the simplicity of his language, his playful mode and his attention to
subjects such as war and sex.The poet and critic Randall Jarrell once noted
that Cummings is “one of the most individual poets who ever lived—and, though
it sometimes seems so, it is not just his vices and exaggerations, the defects
of his qualities, that make a writer popular. But, primarily, Mr. Cummings’s
poems are loved because they are full of sentimentally, of sex, of more or
less improper jokes, of elementary lyric insistence.”During his lifetime,
Cummings received a number of honors, including an Academy of American Poets
Fellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, the Charles Eliot Norton Professorship
at Harvard, the Bollingen Prize in Poetry in 1958, and a Ford Foundation
grant.At the time of his death, September 3, 1962, he was the second most
widely read poet in the United States, after Robert Frost. He is buried in
Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston, Massachusetts.source:

**Born:** April 28, 1926 in Monroeville, Alabama, The United States

**Description:**

Harper Lee, known as Nelle, was born in the Alabama town of Monroeville, the
youngest of four children of Amasa Coleman Lee and Frances Cunningham Finch
Lee. Her father, a former newspaper editor and proprietor, was a lawyer who
served on the state legislature from 1926 to 1938. As a child, Lee was a
tomboy and a precocious reader, and enjoyed the friendship of her schoolmate
and neighbor, the young Truman Capote.After graduating from high school in
Monroeville, Lee enrolled at the all-female Huntingdon College in Montgomery
(1944-45), and then pursued a law degree at the University of Alabama
(1945-50), pledging the Chi Omega sorority. While there, she wrote for several
student publications and spent a year as editor of the campus humor magazine,
""Ramma-Jamma"". Though she did not complete the law degree, she studied for a
summer in Oxford, England, before moving to New York in 1950, where she worked
as a reservation clerk with Eastern Air Lines and BOAC.Lee continued as a
reservation clerk until the late 50s, when she devoted herself to writing. She
lived a frugal life, traveling between her cold-water-only apartment in New
York to her family home in Alabama to care for her father.Having written
several long stories, Harper Lee located an agent in November 1956. The
following month at the East 50th townhouse of her friends Michael Brown and
Joy Williams Brown, she received a gift of a year's wages with a note: ""You
have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry
Christmas."" Within a year, she had a first draft. Working with J. B.
Lippincott & Co. editor Tay Hohoff, she completed To Kill a Mockingbird in the
summer of 1959. Published July 11, 1960, the novel was an immediate bestseller
and won great critical acclaim, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in
1961. It remains a bestseller with more than 30 million copies in print. In

Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet, OM (9 May 1860 – 19 June 1937) was a
Scottish author and dramatist, best remembered today as the creator of Peter
Pan.The child of a family of small-town weavers, he was educated in Scotland.
He moved to London, where he developed a career as a novelist and playwright.
There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired him in writing about a baby
boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (included in The Little
White Bird), then to write Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, a
""fairy play"" about this ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have
adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland. This play quickly overshadowed
his previous work and although he continued to write successfully, it became
his best-known work, credited with popularising the name Wendy, which was very

**Born:** November 27, 1942 in Seattle, Washington, The United States

**Description:**

Jimi Hendrix was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. Hendrix is
considered one of the greatest and most influential guitarists in rock music
history. After initial success in Europe, he achieved fame in the USA
following his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, Hendrix
headlined the iconic 1969 Woodstock Festival.Hendrix helped develop the
technique of guitar feedback with overdriven amplifiers. He was influenced by
blues artists such as B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Albert King, and Elmore James,
rhythm and blues and soul guitarists Curtis Mayfield, Steve Cropper, as well
as by some modern jazz.Carlos Santana has suggested that Hendrix's music may
have been influenced by his Native American heritage. As a record producer,
Hendrix also broke new ground in using the recording studio as an extension of
his musical ideas; he was one of the first to experiment with stereophonic and
phasing effects during recording.Hendrix won many of the most prestigious rock
music awards in his lifetime and has been posthumously awarded many more,
including being inducted into the USA's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and
the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. An English Heritage ""Blue plaque"" was
erected in his name on his former residence at Brook Street, London in
September 1997 and his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (at 6627 Hollywood
Blvd.) was dedicated in 1994. In 2006, his debut USA album, Are You
Experienced, was inducted into the United States National Recording Registry
and Rolling Stone named Hendrix number 1 on their list of the 100 Greatest

    <p class=""author-description"">
        Jimi Hendrix was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. Hendrix is considered one of the greatest and most influential guitarists in rock music history. After initial success in Europe, he achieved fame in the USA following his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, Hendrix headlined the iconic 1969 Woodstock Festival.Hendrix helped develop the technique of guitar feedback with overdriven amplifiers. He was influenced by blues artists such as B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Albert King, and Elmore James, rhythm and blues and soul guitarists Curtis Mayfield, Steve Cropper, as well as by some modern jazz.Carlos Santana has suggested that Hendrix's music may have been influenced by his Native American heritage. As a record producer, Hendrix also broke new ground in using the recording studio as an extension of his musical ideas; he was one of the first to experiment with stereophonic and phasing effects during recording.Hendrix won many of the most prestigious rock music awards in his lifetime and has been posthumously awarded many more, including being inducted into the USA's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. An English Heritage ""Blue plaque"" was erected in his name on his former residence at Brook Street, London in September 1997 and his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (at 6627 Hollywood Blvd.) was dedicated in 1994. In 2006, his debut USA album, Are You Experienced, was inducted into the United States National Recording Registry and Rolling Stone named Hendrix number 1 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time in 2003.

**Born:** March 04, 1965 in Kabul, Afghanistan

**Description:**

Hosseini was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 1965. In 1970 Hosseini and his
family moved to Iran where his father worked for the Embassy of Afghanistan in
Tehran. In 1973 Hosseini's family returned to Kabul, and Hosseini's youngest
brother was born in July of that year.In 1976, when Hosseini was 11 years old,
Hosseini's father obtained a job in Paris, France, and moved the family there.
They were unable to return to Afghanistan because of the Saur Revolution in
which the PDPA communist party seized power through a bloody coup in April
1978. Instead, a year after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in 1980 they
sought political asylum in the United States and made their residence in San
Jose, California.Hosseini graduated from Independence High School in San Jose
in 1984 and enrolled at Santa Clara University, where he earned a bachelor's
degree in biology in 1988. The following year, he entered the University of
California, San Diego, School of Medicine, where he earned his M.D. in 1993.
He completed his residency in internal medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
in Los Angeles in 1996. He practiced medicine for over ten years, until a year
and a half after the release of The Kite Runner.Hosseini is currently a
Goodwill Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
He has been working to provide humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan through
the Khaled Hosseini Foundation. The concept for the foundation was inspired by
the trip to Afghanistan that Hosseini made in 2007 with UNHCR.He lives in
Northern California with his wife, Roya, and their two children (Harris and

**Born:** November 29, 1918 in New York City, New York, The United States

**Description:**

Madeleine L'Engle was an American writer best known for her Young Adult
fiction, particularly the Newbery Medal-winning A Wrinkle in Time and its
sequels A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, and Many Waters. Her
works reflect her strong interest in modern science: tesseracts, for example,
are featured prominently in A Wrinkle in Time, mitochondrial DNA in A Wind in
the Door, organ regeneration in The Arm of the Starfish, and so
forth.""Madeleine was born on November 29th, 1918, and spent her formative
years in New York City. Instead of her school work, she found that she would
much rather be writing stories, poems and journals for herself, which was
reflected in her grades (not the best). However, she was not discouraged.At
age 12, she moved to the French Alps with her parents and went to an English
boarding school where, thankfully, her passion for writing continued to grow.
She flourished during her high school years back in the United States at
Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina, vacationing with her mother in a
rambling old beach cottage on a beautiful stretch of Florida Beach.She went to
Smith College and studied English with some wonderful teachers as she read the
classics and continued her own creative writing. She graduated with honors and
moved into a Greenwich Village apartment in New York. She worked in the
theater, where Equity union pay and a flexible schedule afforded her the time
to write! She published her first two novels during these years--A Small Rain
and Ilsa--before meeting Hugh Franklin, her future husband, when she was an
understudy in Anton Chekov's The Cherry Orchard. They married during The
Joyous Season.She had a baby girl and kept on writing, eventually moving to
Connecticut to raise the family away from the city in a small dairy farm
village with more cows than people. They bought a dead general store, and
brought it to life for 9 years. They moved back to the city with three
children, and Hugh revitalized his professional acting career. The family has
kept the country house, Crosswicks, and continues to spend summers there.As
the years passed and the children grew, Madeleine continued to write and Hugh
to act, and they to enjoy each other and life. Madeleine began her association
with the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, where she has been the
librarian and maintained an office for more than thirty years. After Hugh's
death in 1986, it was her writing and lecturing that kept her going. She has
now lived through the 20th century and into the 21st and has written over 60
books and keeps writing. She enjoys being with her friends, her children, her
grandchildren, and her great
grandchildren.""http://us.macmillan.com/author/madele...Copyright © 2007

who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most

“Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely
ridiculous than absolutely boring.” by Marilyn Monroe (about)

“I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” by Thomas A.
Edison (about)

“This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up
sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how
you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it
anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you
through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them.
Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers,
well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them -
actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't
give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never
find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because
you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold
on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then
who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most
importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so
much to smile about.” by Marilyn Monroe (about)

“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is

indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.” by
