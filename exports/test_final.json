He completed his Ph.D. at\nthe University of Zurich by 1909. His 1905 paper explaining the photoelectric\neffect, the basis of electronics, earned him the Nobel Prize in 1921. His\nfirst paper on Special Relativity Theory, also published in 1905, changed the\nworld. After the rise of the Nazi party, Einstein made Princeton his permanent\nhome, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1940. Einstein, a pacifist during World War\nI, stayed a firm proponent of social justice and responsibility. He chaired\nthe Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists, which organized to alert the\npublic to the dangers of atomic warfare.At a symposium, he advised: \"In their\nstruggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to\ngive up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear\nand hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In\ntheir labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are\ncapable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\nitself. This is, to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy\ntask . . . \" (\"Science, Philosophy and Religion, A Symposium,\" published by\nthe Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in their Relation to the\nDemocratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941). In a letter to philosopher Eric\nGutkind, dated Jan. 3, 1954, Einstein stated: \"The word god is for me nothing\nmore than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a\ncollection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless\npretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change\nthis,\" (The Guardian, \"Childish superstition: Einstein's letter makes view of\nreligion relatively clear,\" by James Randerson, May 13, 2008). D. 1955.While\nbest known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been\ndubbed \"the world's most famous equation\"), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize\nin Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his\ndiscovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The latter was pivotal in\nestablishing quantum theory.Einstein thought that Newtonion mechanics was no\nlonger enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of\nthe electromagnetic field. This led to the development of his special theory\nof relativity. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could\nalso be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of\ngravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity.\nHe continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum\ntheory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of\nmolecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the\nfoundation of the photon theory of light.He was visiting the United States\nwhen Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 and did not go back to Germany. On the\neve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt\nalerting him to the potential development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a\nnew type\" and recommending that the U.S. begin similar research. This\neventually led to what would become the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported\ndefending the Allied forces, but largely denounced the idea of using the newly\ndiscovered nuclear fission as a weapon. Later, with Bertrand Russell, Einstein\nsigned the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, which highlighted the danger of nuclear\nweapons.

Her early film appearances were minor, but her\nperformances in The Asphalt Jungle and All About Eve (both 1950), drew\nattention. By 1952 she had her first leading role in Don't Bother to Knock and\n1953 brought a lead in Niagara, a melodramatic film noir that dwelt on her\nseductiveness. Her \"dumb blonde\" persona was used to comic effect in\nsubsequent films such as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), How to Marry a\nMillionaire (1953) and The Seven Year Itch (1955). Limited by typecasting,\nMonroe studied at the Actors Studio to broaden her range. Her dramatic\nperformance in Bus Stop (1956) was hailed by critics and garnered a Golden\nGlobe nomination. Her production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, released\nThe Prince and the Showgirl (1957), for which she received a BAFTA Award\nnomination and won a David di Donatello award. She received a Golden Globe\nAward for her performance in Some Like It Hot (1959). Monroe's last completed\nfilm was The Misfits, co-starring Clark Gable with screenplay by her then-\nhusband, Arthur Miller.Marilyn was a passionate reader, owning four hundred\nbooks at the time of her death, and was often photographed with a book.The\nfinal years of Monroe's life were marked by illness, personal problems, and a\nreputation for unreliability and being difficult to work with. The\ncircumstances of her death, from an overdose of barbiturates, have been the\nsubject of conjecture. Though officially classified as a \"probable suicide\",\nthe possibility of an accidental overdose, as well as of homicide, have not\nbeen ruled out. In 1999, Monroe was ranked as the sixth greatest female star\nof all time by the American Film Institute. In the decades following her\ndeath, she has often been cited as both a pop and a cultural icon as well as\nthe quintessential American sex symbol.",

        "content_text": "### Dr. Seuss\n\n**Born:** March 02, 1904 in Springfield, MA, The United States\n\n**Description:**\n\nTheodor Seuss Geisel was born 2 March 1904 in Springfield, MA. He graduated\nDartmouth College in 1925, and proceeded on to Oxford University with the\nintent of acquiring a doctorate in literature. At Oxford he met Helen Palmer,\nwho he wed in 1927. He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a\nmagazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time,\nsubmitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. Additionally, he was\nsubmitting cartoons to Life, Vanity Fair and Liberty. In some of his works,\nhe'd made reference to an insecticide called Flit. These references gained\nnotice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for Flit. This association\nlasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase\n\"Quick, Henry, the Flit!\" In 1936 on the way to a vaction in Europe, listening\nto the rhythm of the ship's engines, he came up with And to Think That I Saw\nIt on Mulberry Street, which was then promptly rejected by the first 43\npublishers he showed it to. Eventually in 1937 a friend published the book for\nhim, and it went on to at least moderate success. During WW II, Geisel joined\nthe army and was sent to Hollywood. Captain Geisel would write for Frank\nCapra's Signal Corps Unit (for which he won the Legion of Merit) and do\ndocumentaries (he won Oscar's for Hitler Lives and Design for Death). He also\ncreated a cartoon called Gerald McBoing-Boing which also won him an Oscar. In\nMay of 1954, Life published a report concerning illiteracy among school\nchildren. The report said, among other things, that children were having\ntrouble to read because their books were boring.

He graduated Dartmouth College in 1925, and proceeded on to Oxford University with the intent of acquiring a doctorate in literature. At Oxford he met Helen Palmer, who he wed in 1927. He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a magazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time, submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. Additionally, he was submitting cartoons to Life, Vanity Fair and Liberty. In some of his works, he'd made reference to an insecticide called Flit. These references gained notice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for Flit. This association lasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase \"Quick, Henry, the Flit!\" In 1936 on the way to a vaction in Europe, listening to the rhythm of the ship's engines, he came up with And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, which was then promptly rejected by the first 43 publishers he showed it to. Eventually in 1937 a friend published the book for him, and it went on to at least moderate success. During WW II, Geisel joined the army and was sent to Hollywood. Captain Geisel would write for Frank Capra's Signal Corps Unit (for which he won the Legion of Merit) and do documentaries (he won Oscar's for Hitler Lives and Design for Death). He also created a cartoon called Gerald McBoing-Boing which also won him an Oscar. In May of 1954, Life published a report concerning illiteracy among school children. The report said, among other things, that children were having trouble to read because their books were boring. This inspired Geisel's publisher, and prompted him to send Geisel a list of 400 words he felt were important, asked him to cut the list to 250 words (the publishers idea of how many words at one time a first grader could absorb), and write a book. Nine months later, Geisel, using 220 of the words given to him published The Cat in the Hat, which went on to instant success.

        "content_text": "### Garrison Keillor\n\n**Born:** August 07, 1942 in Anoka, Minnesota, The United States\n\n**Description:**\n\nGarrison Keillor (born Gary Edward Keillor on August 7, 1942 in Anoka,\nMinnesota) is an American author, storyteller, humorist, columnist, musician,\nsatirist, and radio personality. He is known as host of the Minnesota Public\nRadio show \"A Prairie Home Companion\".Keillor was born in Anoka, Minnesota,\nthe son of Grace Ruth (née Denham) and John Philip Keillor, who was a\ncarpenter and postal worker. His father had English ancestry, partly by way of\nCanada (Keillor's paternal grandfather was from Kingston, Ontario). His\nmaternal grandparents were Scottish immigrants, from Glasgow. The family\nbelonged to the Plymouth Brethren, a fundamentalist Christian denomination\nKeillor has since left. He is six feet, three inches (1.9 m) tall. Keillor is\na member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. In 2006 he told Christianity\nToday that he was attending the Episcopal church in Saint Paul, after\npreviously attending a Lutheran church in New York.Keillor graduated from\nAnoka High School in 1960 and from the University of Minnesota with a\nbachelor's degree in English in 1966. During college, he began his\nbroadcasting career on the student-operated radio station known today as Radio\nK.Keillor has been married three times.Garrison Keillor started his\nprofessional radio career in November 1969 with Minnesota Educational Radio,\nnow Minnesota Public Radio. He hosted The Morning Program on weekdays from 6\nto 9 a.m. on KSJR 90.1 FM at St. John's University, which the station called\n\"A Prairie Home Entertainment.\" The show's eclectic music was a major\ndivergence from the station's usual classical fare. During this time he also\nbegan submitting fiction to The New Yorker, where his first story, \"Local\nFamily Keeps Son Happy,\" appeared on September 19, 1970.Keillor resigned from\nThe Morning Program in February 1971 to protest a perceived attempt to\ninterfere with his musical programming. The show became A Prairie Home\nCompanion when he returned in October.A Prairie Home Companion debuted as an\nold-style variety show before a live audience on July 6, 1974, featuring guest\nmusicians and a cadre cast doing musical numbers and comic skits replete with\nelaborate live sound effects. The show was punctuated by spoof commercial\nspots from fictitious sponsors such as Powdermilk Biscuits. The show also\ncontains parodic serial melodramas, such as The Adventures of Guy Noir,\nPrivate Eye and The Lives of the Cowboys. Keillor voices Noir and other\nrecurring characters, and also provides vocals for some of the show's musical\nnumbers.A Prairie Home Companion ran until 1987, when Keillor decided to end\nit to focus on other projects. In 1989, he launched another live radio program\nfrom New York City, \"The American Radio Company of the Air\" — which had almost\nthe same format as A Prairie Home Companion's. In 1992, he moved ARC back to\nSt. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to A Prairie Home Companion;\nit has remained a Saturday night fixture ever since.Keillor has been called\n\"[o]ne of the most perceptive and witty commentators about Midwestern life\" by\nRandall Balmer in Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism.

He is known as host of the Minnesota Public Radio show \"A Prairie Home Companion\".Keillor was born in Anoka, Minnesota, the son of Grace Ruth (née Denham) and John Philip Keillor, who was a carpenter and postal worker. His father had English ancestry, partly by way of Canada (Keillor's paternal grandfather was from Kingston, Ontario). His maternal grandparents were Scottish immigrants, from Glasgow. The family belonged to the Plymouth Brethren, a fundamentalist Christian denomination Keillor has since left. He is six feet, three inches (1.9 m) tall. Keillor is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. In 2006 he told Christianity Today that he was attending the Episcopal church in Saint Paul, after previously attending a Lutheran church in New York.Keillor graduated from Anoka High School in 1960 and from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor's degree in English in 1966. During college, he began his broadcasting career on the student-operated radio station known today as Radio K.Keillor has been married three times.Garrison Keillor started his professional radio career in November 1969 with Minnesota Educational Radio, now Minnesota Public Radio. He hosted The Morning Program on weekdays from 6 to 9 a.m. on KSJR 90.1 FM at St. John's University, which the station called \"A Prairie Home Entertainment.\" The show's eclectic music was a major divergence from the station's usual classical fare. During this time he also began submitting fiction to The New Yorker, where his first story, \"Local Family Keeps Son Happy,\" appeared on September 19, 1970.Keillor resigned from The Morning Program in February 1971 to protest a perceived attempt to interfere with his musical programming. The show became A Prairie Home Companion when he returned in October.A Prairie Home Companion debuted as an old-style variety show before a live audience on July 6, 1974, featuring guest musicians and a cadre cast doing musical numbers and comic skits replete with elaborate live sound effects. The show was punctuated by spoof commercial spots from fictitious sponsors such as Powdermilk Biscuits. The show also contains parodic serial melodramas, such as The Adventures of Guy Noir, Private Eye and The Lives of the Cowboys. Keillor voices Noir and other recurring characters, and also provides vocals for some of the show's musical numbers.A Prairie Home Companion ran until 1987, when Keillor decided to end it to focus on other projects. In 1989, he launched another live radio program from New York City, \"The American Radio Company of the Air\" — which had almost the same format as A Prairie Home Companion's. In 1992, he moved ARC back to St. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to A Prairie Home Companion; it has remained a Saturday night fixture ever since.Keillor has been called \"[o]ne of the most perceptive and witty commentators about Midwestern life\" by Randall Balmer in Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism. He has written numerous magazine and newspaper articles and more than a dozen books for adults as well as children. He has also written for Salon.com and authored an advice column at Salon.com under the name \"Mr. Blue.\"In 2004 Keillor published a collection of political essays, Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart of America, and in June 2005 he began a column called \"The Old Scout\", which ran at Salon.com and in syndicated newspapers. The column went on hiatus in April 2010.Keillor wrote the screenplay for the 2006 movie A Prairie Home Companion, directed by Robert Altman.

        "content_text": "### Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n**Born:** May 25, 1803 in Boston, Massachusetts, The United States\n\n**Description:**\n\nin 1803, Ralph Waldo Emerson was born in Boston. Educated at Harvard and the\nCambridge Divinity School, he became a Unitarian minister in 1826 at the\nSecond Church Unitarian. The congregation, with Christian overtones, issued\ncommunion, something Emerson refused to do. \"Really, it is beyond my\ncomprehension,\" Emerson once said, when asked by a seminary professor whether\nhe believed in God. (Quoted in 2,000 Years of Freethought edited by Jim\nHaught.) By 1832, after the untimely death of his first wife, Emerson cut\nloose from Unitarianism. During a year-long trip to Europe, Emerson became\nacquainted with such intelligentsia as British writer Thomas Carlyle, and\npoets Wordsworth and Coleridge. He returned to the United States in 1833, to a\nlife as poet, writer and lecturer. Emerson inspired Transcendentalism,\nalthough never adopting the label himself. He rejected traditional ideas of\ndeity in favor of an \"Over-Soul\" or \"Form of Good,\" ideas which were\nconsidered highly heretical. His books include Nature (1836), The American\nScholar (1837), Divinity School Address (1838), Essays, 2 vol. (1841, 1844),\nNature, Addresses and Lectures (1849), and three volumes of poetry. Margaret\nFuller became one of his \"disciples,\" as did Henry David Thoreau.The best of\nEmerson's rather wordy writing survives as epigrams, such as the famous: \"A\nfoolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little\nstatesmen and philosophers and divines.\" Other one- (and two-) liners include:\n\"As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of\nthe intellect\" (Self-Reliance, 1841). \"The most tedious of all discourses are\non the subject of the Supreme Being\" (Journal, 1836). \"The word miracle, as\npronounced by Christian churches, gives a false impression; it is a monster.\nIt is not one with the blowing clover and the falling rain\" (Address to\nHarvard Divinity College, July 15, 1838). He demolished the right wing\nhypocrites of his era in his essay \"Worship\": \". . . the louder he talked of\nhis honor, the faster we counted our spoons\" (Conduct of Life, 1860). \"I hate\nthis shallow Americanism which hopes to get rich by credit, to get knowledge\nby raps on midnight tables, to learn the economy of the mind by phrenology, or\nskill without study, or mastery without apprenticeship\" (Self-Reliance). \"The\nfirst and last lesson of religion is, 'The things that are seen are temporal;\nthe things that are not seen are eternal.'

Educated at Harvard and the Cambridge Divinity School, he became a Unitarian minister in 1826 at the Second Church Unitarian. The congregation, with Christian overtones, issued communion, something Emerson refused to do. \"Really, it is beyond my comprehension,\" Emerson once said, when asked by a seminary professor whether he believed in God. (Quoted in 2,000 Years of Freethought edited by Jim Haught.) By 1832, after the untimely death of his first wife, Emerson cut loose from Unitarianism. During a year-long trip to Europe, Emerson became acquainted with such intelligentsia as British writer Thomas Carlyle, and poets Wordsworth and Coleridge. He returned to the United States in 1833, to a life as poet, writer and lecturer. Emerson inspired Transcendentalism, although never adopting the label himself. He rejected traditional ideas of deity in favor of an \"Over-Soul\" or \"Form of Good,\" ideas which were considered highly heretical. His books include Nature (1836), The American Scholar (1837), Divinity School Address (1838), Essays, 2 vol. (1841, 1844), Nature, Addresses and Lectures (1849), and three volumes of poetry. Margaret Fuller became one of his \"disciples,\" as did Henry David Thoreau.The best of Emerson's rather wordy writing survives as epigrams, such as the famous: \"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.\" Other one- (and two-) liners include: \"As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect\" (Self-Reliance, 1841). \"The most tedious of all discourses are on the subject of the Supreme Being\" (Journal, 1836). \"The word miracle, as pronounced by Christian churches, gives a false impression; it is a monster. It is not one with the blowing clover and the falling rain\" (Address to Harvard Divinity College, July 15, 1838). He demolished the right wing hypocrites of his era in his essay \"Worship\": \". . . the louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our spoons\" (Conduct of Life, 1860). \"I hate this shallow Americanism which hopes to get rich by credit, to get knowledge by raps on midnight tables, to learn the economy of the mind by phrenology, or skill without study, or mastery without apprenticeship\" (Self-Reliance). \"The first and last lesson of religion is, 'The things that are seen are temporal; the things that are not seen are eternal.' It puts an affront upon nature\" (English Traits , 1856). \"The god of the cannibals will be a cannibal, of the crusaders a crusader, and of the merchants a merchant.\" (Civilization, 1862). He influenced generations of Americans, from his friend Henry David Thoreau to John Dewey, and in Europe, Friedrich Nietzsche, who takes up such Emersonian themes as power, fate, the uses of poetry and history, and the critique of Christianity.

Schulz\n\n**Born:** November 26, 1922 in Minneapolis, MN, The United States\n\n**Description:**\n\nCharles Monroe Schulz was an American cartoonist, whose comic strip Peanuts\nproved one of the most popular and influential in the history of the medium,\nand is still widely reprinted on a daily basis.Schulz's first regular\ncartoons, Li'l Folks, were published from 1947 to 1950 by the St. Paul Pioneer\nPress; he first used the name Charlie Brown for a character there, although he\napplied the name in four gags to three different boys and one buried in sand.\nThe series also had a dog that looked much like Snoopy. In 1948, Schulz sold a\ncartoon to The Saturday Evening Post; the first of 17 single-panel cartoons by\nSchulz that would be published there. In 1948, Schulz tried to have Li'l Folks\nsyndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association. Schulz would have\nbeen an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but\nthe deal fell through. Li'l Folks was dropped from the Pioneer Press in\nJanuary, 1950.Later that year, Schulz approached the United Feature Syndicate\nwith his best strips from Li'l Folks, and Peanuts made its first appearance on\nOctober 2, 1950. The strip became one of the most popular comic strips of all\ntime. He also had a short-lived sports-oriented comic strip called It's Only a\nGame (1957–1959), but he abandoned it due to the demands of the successful\nPeanuts. From 1956 to 1965 he contributed a single-panel strip (\"Young\nPillars\") featuring teenagers to Youth, a publication associated with the\nChurch of God.Peanuts ran for nearly 50 years, almost without interruption;\nduring the life of the strip, Schulz took only one vacation, a five-week break\nin late 1997. At its peak, Peanuts appeared in more than 2,600 newspapers in\n75 countries. Schulz stated that his routine every morning consisted of eating\na jelly donut and sitting down to write the day's strip. After coming up with\nan idea (which he said could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours),\nhe began drawing it, which took about an hour for dailies and three hours for\nSunday strips. He stubbornly refused to hire an inker or letterer, saying that\n\"it would be equivalent to a golfer hiring a man to make his putts for him.\"\nIn November 1999 Schulz suffered a stroke, and later it was discovered that he\nhad colon cancer that had metastasized. Because of the chemotherapy and the\nfact he could not read or see clearly, he announced his retirement on December\n14, 1999. Schulz often touched on religious themes in his work, including the\nclassic television cartoon, A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965), which features\nthe character Linus van Pelt quoting the King James Version of the Bible Luke\n2:8-14 to explain \"what Christmas is all about.\" In personal interviews Schulz\nmentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side. Schulz, reared in the\nLutheran faith, had been active in the Church of God as a young adult and then\nlater taught Sunday school at a United Methodist Church. In the 1960s, Robert\nL. Short interpreted certain themes and conversations in Peanuts as being\nconsistent with parts of Christian theology, and used them as illustrations\nduring his lectures about the gospel, as he explained in his bestselling\npaperback book, The Gospel According to Peanuts, the first of several books he\nwrote on religion and Peanuts, and other popular culture items.From the late\n1980s, however, Schulz described himself in interviews as a \"secular\nhumanist\": “I do not go to church anymore... I guess you might say I've come\naround to secular humanism, an obligation I believe all humans have to others\nand the world we live in.”",

Mary\nAnn, the youngest child and a favorite of her father's, received a good\neducation for a young woman of her day. Influenced by a favorite governess,\nshe became a religious evangelical as an adolescent. Her first published work\nwas a religious poem. Through a family friend, she was exposed to Charles\nHennell's An Inquiry into the Origins of Christianity. Unable to believe, she\nconscientiously gave up religion and stopped attending church. Her father\nshunned her, sending the broken-hearted young dependent to live with a sister\nuntil she promised to reexamine her feelings. Her intellectual views did not,\nhowever, change. She translated David Strauss' Das Leben Jesu, a monumental\ntask, without signing her name to the 1846 work. After her father's death in\n1849, Mary Ann traveled, then accepted an unpaid position with The Westminster\nReview. Despite a heavy workload, she translated Ludwig Feuerbach's The\nEssence of Christianity, the only book ever published under her real name.\nThat year, the shy, respectable writer scandalized British society by sending\nnotices to friends announcing she had entered a free \"union\" with George Henry\nLewes, editor of The Leader, who was unable to divorce his first wife. They\nlived harmoniously together for the next 24 years, but suffered social\nostracism and financial hardship. She became salaried and began writing essays\nand reviews for The Westminster Review. Renaming herself \"Marian\" in private\nlife and adopting the nom de plume \"George Eliot,\" she began her impressive\nfiction career, including: Adam Bede (1859), The Mill on the Floss (1860),\nSilas Marner (1861), Romola (1863), and Middlemarch (1871). Themes included\nher humanist vision and strong heroines. Her poem, \"O May I Join the Choir\nInvisible\" expressed her views about non supernatural immortality: \"O may I\njoin the choir invisible/ Of those immortal dead who live again/ In minds made\nbetter by their presence. . .\" D. 1880.Her 1872 work Middlemarch has been\ndescribed by Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the\nEnglish language.More:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E...http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic...http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/t...http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian...http://www.biography.com/people/georg...http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/d...",

Eldridge Cleaver, of the Black Panthers, stated the Baldwin's writing displayed an \"agonizing, total hatred of blacks.\" Baldwin's play, Blues for Mister Charlie, was produced in 1964. Going to Meet the Man and Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone provided powerful descriptions of American racism. As an openly gay man, he became increasingly outspoken in condemning discrimination against lesbian and gay people.On November 30, 1987 Baldwin died from stomach cancer in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France.He was buried at the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, near New York City.    \n    </p>\n</div>\n\n    </div></body></html>",

During 1831 his father legally recognized him and ensured that the\nyoung Dumas received the best education possible at the Institution Goubaux\nand the Collège Bourbon. At that time, the law allowed the elder Dumas to take\nthe child away from his mother. Her agony inspired Dumas fils to write about\ntragic female characters. In almost all of his writings, he emphasized the\nmoral purpose of literature and in his play The Illegitimate Son (1858) he\nespoused the belief that if a man fathers an illegitimate child then he has an\nobligation to legitimize the child and marry the woman.Dumas' paternal great-\ngrandparents were a French nobleman and a Haitian woman. In boarding schools,\nDumas fils was constantly taunted by his classmates. These issues all\nprofoundly influenced his thoughts, behaviour, and writing.During 1844 Dumas\nmoved to Saint-Germain-en-Laye to live with his father. There, he met Marie\nDuplessis, a young courtesan who would be the inspiration for his romantic\nnovel The Lady of the Camellias. Adapted into a play, it was titled in English\n(especially in the United States) as Camille and is the basis for Verdi's 1853\nopera, La Traviata. Although he admitted that he had done the adaptation\nbecause he needed the money, he had a great success with the play. Thus began\nthe career of Dumas fils as a dramatist, which was not only more renowned than\nthat of his father during his lifetime but also dominated the serious French\nstage for most of the second half of the 19th century. After this, he\nvirtually abandoned writing novels (though his semi-autobiographical L'Affaire\nClemenceau (1867) achieved some success).On 31 December 1864, in Moscow, Dumas\nmarried Nadjeschda von Knorring (1826 – April 1895), daughter of Johan\nReinhold von Knorring and wife, and widow of Alexander, Prince Naryschkine.\nThe couple had two daughters: Marie-Alexandrine-Henriette Dumas, born 20\nNovember 1860, who married Maurice Lippmann and was the mother of Serge\nNapoléon Lippmann (1886–1975) and Auguste Alexandre Lippmann (1881–1960); and\nJeanine Dumas (3 May 1867–), who married Ernest d' Hauterive (1864–1957), son\nof George Lecourt d' Hauterive and wife (married in 1861) Léontine de Leusse.\nAfter Naryschkine's death, he married in June 1895 Henriette Régnier de La\nBrière (1851–1934), without issue.During 1874, he was admitted to the Académie\nfrançaise, and in 1894 he was awarded the Légion d'honneur.Alexandre Dumas\nfils died at Marly-le-Roi, Yvelines, on November 27, 1895 and was interred in\nthe Cimetière de Montmartre in Paris. His grave is, perhaps coincidentally,\nonly some 100 metres away from that of Marie Duplessis.",

The couple had two daughters: Marie-Alexandrine-Henriette Dumas, born 20 November 1860, who married Maurice Lippmann and was the mother of Serge Napoléon Lippmann (1886–1975) and Auguste Alexandre Lippmann (1881–1960); and Jeanine Dumas (3 May 1867–), who married Ernest d' Hauterive (1864–1957), son of George Lecourt d' Hauterive and wife (married in 1861) Léontine de Leusse. After Naryschkine's death, he married in June 1895 Henriette Régnier de La Brière (1851–1934), without issue.During 1874, he was admitted to the Académie française, and in 1894 he was awarded the Légion d'honneur.Alexandre Dumas fils died at Marly-le-Roi, Yvelines, on November 27, 1895 and was interred in the Cimetière de Montmartre in Paris. His grave is, perhaps coincidentally, only some 100 metres away from that of Marie Duplessis.    \n    </p>\n</div>\n\n    </div></body></html>",

Rendered deaf and blind at 19\nmonths by scarlet fever, she learned to read (in several languages) and even\nspeak, eventually graduating with honors from Radcliffe College in 1904, where\nas a student she wrote The Story of My Life. That she accomplished all of this\nin an age when few women attended college and the disabled were often\nrelegated to the background, spoken of only in hushed tones, is remarkable.\nBut Keller's many other achievements are impressive by any standard: she\nauthored 13 books, wrote countless articles, and devoted her life to social\nreform. An active and effective suffragist, pacifist, and socialist (the\nlatter association earned her an FBI file), she lectured on behalf of disabled\npeople everywhere. She also helped start several foundations that continue to\nimprove the lives of the deaf and blind around the world. As a young girl\nKeller was obstinate, prone to fits of violence, and seething with rage at her\ninability to express herself. But at the age of 7 this wild child was\ntransformed when, at the urging of Alexander Graham Bell, Anne Sullivan became\nher teacher, an event she declares \"the most important day I remember in all\nmy life.\" (Sullivan herself had once been blind, but partially recovered her\nsight after a series of operations.) In a memorable passage, Keller writes of\nthe day \"Teacher\" led her to a stream and repeatedly spelled out the letters\nw-a-t-e-r on one of her hands while pouring water over the other. This method\nproved a revelation: \"That living world awakened my soul, gave it light, hope,\njoy, set it free! There were barriers still, it is true, but barriers that\ncould in time be swept away.\" And, indeed, most of them were. In her lovingly\ncrafted and deeply perceptive autobiography, Keller's joyous spirit is most\nvividly expressed in her connection to nature: Indeed, everything that could\nhum, or buzz, or sing, or bloom, had a part in my education.... Few know what\njoy it is to feel the roses pressing softly into the hand, or the beautiful\nmotion of the lilies as they sway in the morning breeze. Sometimes I caught an\ninsect in the flower I was plucking, and I felt the faint noise of a pair of\nwings rubbed together in a sudden terror.... The idea of feeling rather than\nhearing a sound, or of admiring a flower's motion rather than its color,\nevokes a strong visceral sensation in the reader, giving The Story of My Life\na subtle power and beauty. Keller's celebration of discovery becomes our own.\nIn the end, this blind and deaf woman succeeds in sharpening our eyes and ears\nto the beauty of the world. --Shawn Carkonen",

Sometimes I caught an insect in the flower I was plucking, and I felt the faint noise of a pair of wings rubbed together in a sudden terror....  The idea of feeling rather than hearing a sound, or of admiring a flower's motion rather than its color, evokes a strong visceral sensation in the reader, giving The Story of My Life a subtle power and beauty. Keller's celebration of discovery becomes our own. In the end, this blind and deaf woman succeeds in sharpening our eyes and ears to the beauty of the world. --Shawn Carkonen    \n    </p>\n</div>\n\n    </div></body></html>",

Rendered deaf and blind at 19 months by scarlet fever, she learned to read (in several languages) and even speak, eventually graduating with honors from Radcliffe College in 1904, where as a student she wrote The Story of My Life. That she accomplished all of this in an age when few women attended college and the disabled were often relegated to the background, spoken of only in hushed tones, is remarkable. But Keller's many other achievements are impressive",

        "content_text": "### Charles Bukowski\n\n**Born:** August 16, 1920 in Andernach, Germany\n\n**Description:**\n\nHenry Charles Bukowski (born as Heinrich Karl Bukowski) was a German-born\nAmerican poet, novelist and short story writer. His writing was influenced by\nthe social, cultural and economic ambience of his home city of Los Angeles.It\nis marked by an emphasis on the ordinary lives of poor Americans, the act of\nwriting, alcohol, relationships with women and the drudgery of work. Bukowski\nwrote thousands of poems, hundreds of short stories and six novels, eventually\npublishing over sixty booksCharles Bukowski was the only child of an American\nsoldier and a German mother. At the age of three, he came with his family to\nthe United States and grew up in Los Angeles. He attended Los Angeles City\nCollege from 1939 to 1941, then left school and moved to New York City to\nbecome a writer. His lack of publishing success at this time caused him to\ngive up writing in 1946 and spurred a ten-year stint of heavy drinking. After\nhe developed a bleeding ulcer, he decided to take up writing again. He worked\na wide range of jobs to support his writing, including dishwasher, truck\ndriver and loader, mail carrier, guard, gas station attendant, stock boy,\nwarehouse worker, shipping clerk, post office clerk, parking lot attendant,\nRed Cross orderly, and elevator operator.

At the age of three, he came with his family to the United States and grew up in Los Angeles. He attended Los Angeles City College from 1939 to 1941, then left school and moved to New York City to become a writer. His lack of publishing success at this time caused him to give up writing in 1946 and spurred a ten-year stint of heavy drinking. After he developed a bleeding ulcer, he decided to take up writing again. He worked a wide range of jobs to support his writing, including dishwasher, truck driver and loader, mail carrier, guard, gas station attendant, stock boy, warehouse worker, shipping clerk, post office clerk, parking lot attendant, Red Cross orderly, and elevator operator.

He was a close friend of\nC.S. Lewis.Christopher Tolkien published a series of works based on his\nfather's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The\nSilmarillion . These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form\na connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and\nliterary essays about an imagined world called Arda, and Middle-earth within\nit. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the word \"legendarium\" to the\nlarger part of these writings. While many other authors had published works of\nfantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the\nRings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused\nTolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy\nliterature—or more precisely, high fantasy. Tolkien's writings have inspired\nmany other works of fantasy and have had a lasting effect on the entire\nfield.In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest\nBritish writers since 1945\".

Tolkien was an advisor for the translation of the\nJerusalem Bible . Tolkien once described The Lord of the Rings to his friend\nRobert Murray, an English Jesuit priest, as \"a fundamentally religious and\nCatholic work, unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.\"\nThere are many theological themes underlying the narrative including the\nbattle of good versus evil, the triumph of humility over pride, and the\nactivity of grace. In addition the saga includes themes which incorporate\ndeath and immortality, mercy and pity, resurrection, salvation, repentance,\nself-sacrifice, free will, justice, fellowship, authority and healing. In\naddition The Lord's Prayer \"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us\nfrom evil\" was reportedly present in Tolkien's mind as he described Frodo's\nstruggles against the power of the \"One Ring.''",

Salinger\n\n**Born:** January 01, 1919 in Manhattan, New York, The United States\n\n**Description:**\n\nJerome David Salinger was an American author, best known for his 1951 novel\nThe Catcher in the Rye, as well as his reclusive nature. His last original\npublished work was in 1965; he gave his last interview in 1980. Raised in\nManhattan, Salinger began writing short stories while in secondary school, and\npublished several stories in the early 1940s before serving in World War II.\nIn 1948 he published the critically acclaimed story \"A Perfect Day for\nBananafish\" in The New Yorker magazine, which became home to much of his\nsubsequent work. In 1951 Salinger released his novel The Catcher in the Rye,\nan immediate popular success. His depiction of adolescent alienation and loss\nof innocence in the protagonist Holden Caulfield was influential, especially\namong adolescent readers. The novel remains widely read and controversial,\nselling around 250,000 copies a year.The success of The Catcher in the Rye led\nto public attention and scrutiny: Salinger became reclusive, publishing new\nwork less frequently. He followed Catcher with a short story collection, Nine\nStories (1953), a collection of a novella and a short story, Franny and Zooey\n(1961), and a collection of two novellas, Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters\nand Seymour: An Introduction (1963). His last published work, a novella\nentitled \"Hapworth 16, 1924\", appeared in The New Yorker on June 19,\n1965.Afterward, Salinger struggled with unwanted attention, including a legal\nbattle in the 1980s with biographer Ian Hamilton and the release in the late\n1990s of memoirs written by two people close to him: Joyce Maynard, an ex-\nlover; and Margaret Salinger, his daughter. In 1996, a small publisher\nannounced a deal with Salinger to publish \"Hapworth 16, 1924\" in book form,\nbut amid the ensuing publicity, the release was indefinitely delayed. He made\nheadlines around the globe in June 2009, after filing a lawsuit against\nanother writer for copyright infringement resulting from that writer's use of\none of Salinger's characters from The Catcher in the Rye. Salinger died of\nnatural causes on January 27, 2010, at his home in Cornish, New Hampshire.",

In 1948 he published the critically acclaimed story \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" in The New Yorker magazine, which became home to much of his subsequent work. In 1951 Salinger released his novel The Catcher in the Rye, an immediate popular success. His depiction of adolescent alienation and loss of innocence in the protagonist Holden Caulfield was influential, especially among adolescent readers. The novel remains widely read and controversial, selling around 250,000 copies a year.The success of The Catcher in the Rye led to public attention and scrutiny: Salinger became reclusive, publishing new work less frequently. He followed Catcher with a short story collection, Nine Stories (1953), a collection of a novella and a short story, Franny and Zooey (1961), and a collection of two novellas, Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction (1963). His last published work, a novella entitled \"Hapworth 16, 1924\", appeared in The New Yorker on June 19, 1965.Afterward, Salinger struggled with unwanted attention, including a legal battle in the 1980s with biographer Ian Hamilton and the release in the late 1990s of memoirs written by two people close to him: Joyce Maynard, an ex-lover; and Margaret Salinger, his daughter. In 1996, a small publisher announced a deal with Salinger to publish \"Hapworth 16, 1924\" in book form, but amid the ensuing publicity, the release was indefinitely delayed. He made headlines around the globe in June 2009, after filing a lawsuit against another writer for copyright infringement resulting from that writer's use of one of Salinger's characters from The Catcher in the Rye. Salinger died of natural causes on January 27, 2010, at his home in Cornish, New Hampshire.    \n    </p>\n</div>\n\n    </div></body></html>",

Later in his career, he was often criticized for settling\ninto his signature style and not pressing his work toward further evolution.\nNevertheless, he attained great popularity, especially among young readers,\nfor the simplicity of his language, his playful mode and his attention to\nsubjects such as war and sex.The poet and critic Randall Jarrell once noted\nthat Cummings is “one of the most individual poets who ever lived—and, though\nit sometimes seems so, it is not just his vices and exaggerations, the defects\nof his qualities, that make a writer popular. But, primarily, Mr. Cummings’s\npoems are loved because they are full of sentimentally, of sex, of more or\nless improper jokes, of elementary lyric insistence.”During his lifetime,\nCummings received a number of honors, including an Academy of American Poets\nFellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, the Charles Eliot Norton Professorship\nat Harvard, the Bollingen Prize in Poetry in 1958, and a Ford Foundation\ngrant.At the time of his death, September 3, 1962, he was the second most\nwidely read poet in the United States, after Robert Frost.

Her\nworks reflect her strong interest in modern science: tesseracts, for example,\nare featured prominently in A Wrinkle in Time, mitochondrial DNA in A Wind in\nthe Door, organ regeneration in The Arm of the Starfish, and so\nforth.\"Madeleine was born on November 29th, 1918, and spent her formative\nyears in New York City. Instead of her school work, she found that she would\nmuch rather be writing stories, poems and journals for herself, which was\nreflected in her grades (not the best). However, she was not discouraged.At\nage 12, she moved to the French Alps with her parents and went to an English\nboarding school where, thankfully, her passion for writing continued to grow.\nShe flourished during her high school years back in the United States at\nAshley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina, vacationing with her mother in a\nrambling old beach cottage on a beautiful stretch of Florida Beach.She went to\nSmith College and studied English with some wonderful teachers as she read the\nclassics and continued her own creative writing. She graduated with honors and\nmoved into a Greenwich Village apartment in New York. She worked in the\ntheater, where Equity union pay and a flexible schedule afforded her the time\nto write! She published her first two novels during these years--A Small Rain\nand Ilsa--before meeting Hugh Franklin, her future husband, when she was an\nunderstudy in Anton Chekov's The Cherry Orchard. They married during The\nJoyous Season.She had a baby girl and kept on writing, eventually moving to\nConnecticut to raise the family away from the city in a small dairy farm\nvillage with more cows than people. They bought a dead general store, and\nbrought it to life for 9 years. They moved back to the city with three\nchildren, and Hugh revitalized his professional acting career. The family has\nkept the country house, Crosswicks, and continues to spend summers there.As\nthe years passed and the children grew, Madeleine continued to write and Hugh\nto act, and they to enjoy each other and life. Madeleine began her association\nwith the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, where she has been the\nlibrarian and maintained an office for more than thirty years. After Hugh's\ndeath in 1986, it was her writing and lecturing that kept her going. She has\nnow lived through the 20th century and into the 21st and has written over 60\nbooks and keeps writing. She enjoys being with her friends, her children, her\ngrandchildren, and her great\ngrandchildren.\"http://us.macmillan.com/author/madele...Copyright © 2007\nCrosswicks, Ltd.

So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most\nimportantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so\nmuch to smile about.” by Marilyn Monroe (about)\n\n“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.

She loved before she may\nlove again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you\naren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can\nmake you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making\nmistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can.

You'll never\nfind that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because\nyou fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold\non, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then\nwho will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most\nimportantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so\nmuch to smile about.” by Marilyn Monroe (about)\n\n“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.

No matter what, you're going to mess up\nsometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how\nyou're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it\nanyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you\nthrough everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them.\nAlso remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers,\nwell, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them -\nactually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't\ngive up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never\nfind that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because\nyou fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold\non, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then\nwho will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most\nimportantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so\nmuch to smile about.” by Marilyn Monroe (about)\n\n“You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may\nlove again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you\naren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can\nmake you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making\nmistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking\nabout you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that\nshe knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't\nanalyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you\nhappy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not\nthere.” by Bob Marley (about)\n\n“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is\nnot ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's\nindifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.” by\nElie Wiesel (about)\n\n“It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy\nmarriages.” by Friedrich Nietzsche (about)\n\n“I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply,\nwithout problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any\nother way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that\nyour hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your\neyes close.” by Pablo Neruda (about)\n\n“If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything.” by Marilyn\nMonroe (about)\n\n“The real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or\nsmiling into your eyes or just staring into space.” by Marilyn Monroe (about)\n\n“Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a\nbattle, love is a war; love is a growing up.” by James Baldwin (about)\n\n“There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have\nno notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature.” by Jane Austen\n(about)",

Source Code for Visual\nStudio Code is available at https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode under the MIT\nlicense agreement at\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/LICENSE.txt. Additional license\ninformation can be found in our FAQ at\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq.\n\n# MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS\n\n## MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO CODE\n\nThese license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or\nbased on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the software\nnamed above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the\nsoftware, except to the extent those have different terms.\n\n**IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.**\n\n  1. **INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.**\n     1. **General.** You may use any number of copies of the software to develop and test your applications, including deployment within your internal corporate network. \n     2. **Demo use.** The uses permitted above include use of the software in demonstrating your applications. \n     3. **Third Party Components.** The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file accompanying the software. \n     4. **Extensions.** The software gives you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software packages from our extension marketplace or package managers. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute, license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages. By accessing or using our extension marketplace, you agree to the extension marketplace terms located at https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU. \n  2. **DATA.**\n     1. **Data Collection.** The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation located at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting. There may also be some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with Microsoft’s privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices. \n     2. **Processing of Personal Data.** To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/gdpr. \n  3. **UPDATES.** The software may periodically check for updates and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices. If you do not want automatic updates, you may turn them off by following the instructions in the documentation at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616397. \n  4. **FEEDBACK.** If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement. \n  5. **SCOPE OF LICENSE.** This license applies to the Visual Studio Code product. Source code for Visual Studio Code is available at https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode under the MIT license agreement. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not \n     * reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software except and solely to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the software; \n     * remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;\n     * use the software in any way that is against the law;\n     * share, publish, rent or lease the software, or provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others to use.\n  6. **SUPPORT SERVICES.** Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it. \n  7. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services. \n  8. **EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end-users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, see https://www.microsoft.com/exporting. \n  9. **APPLICABLE LAW.** If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. \n  10. **CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.** This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you: \n     1. **Australia.** You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights. \n     2. **Canada.** If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software. \n     3. **Germany and Austria.**\n        1. **Warranty.** The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software. \n        2. **Limitation of Liability.** In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law. \n\nSubject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight\nnegligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,\nthe fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the\nbreach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the\ncompliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called \"cardinal\nobligations\"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be\nliable for slight negligence.\n\n  11. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.**\n  12. **LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.**\n\nThis limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,\ncontent (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party\napplications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,\nguarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the\nextent permitted by applicable law.\n\nIt also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the\npossibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to\nyou because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of\nincidental, consequential or other damages.",

之關係外，貴用戶取得軟體的單位可能也會提供相關的權利。若貴用戶所在州/省或國家/地區的法律不允許，則本合約無法改變貴用戶的上述其他權利。例如，若貴用戶在下列其中一個國家/地區取得軟體，或具強制性之國家/地區法律適用，則亦適用下列條款：\n\n        <ol type=\"a\">\n          <li>\n            <strong>澳大利亞。</strong>\n            貴用戶依據澳洲消費者法律 (Australian Consumer Law) 享有法定保證，本合約並不意圖影響這些權利。\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <strong>加拿大。</strong>\n            若貴用戶是在加拿大境內取得本軟體，得關閉自動更新功能、中斷裝置之網路連線 (當重新連接網路時，軟體將繼續檢查並安裝更新)，或解除安裝本軟體，以停止接收更新。若有產品文件，當中可能詳述如何關閉特定裝置或軟體之更新。\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <strong>德國及奧地利。</strong>\n\n            <ol type=\"i\">\n              <li>\n

       若為蓄意行為、重大過失、依產品責任法提出之索賠，或造成個人傷亡或實體傷害，Microsoft 將依成文法賠償。\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n\n            <p>\n              根據前述第 (ii) 款，只有在 Microsoft 違反重大合約義務、違反可助本合約實現之履約、違反行為危及本合約之目的，以及違反任何當事人持續信賴之合約遵循 (亦稱為「基本義務」) 的情況下，Microsoft 方得擔負輕過失賠償責任。至於其他的輕微過失，Microsoft 概不擔負相關過失賠償責任。\n            </p>\n          </li>\n        </ol>\n      </li>\n\n

<strong>損害責任之限制與排除。貴用戶僅得就直接損害，要求 Microsoft 及其供應商負擔損害賠償責任，同時金額不得超過 $5.00 美元。貴用戶無法就其他損害 (包括衍生性損害、利潤損失、特殊損害、間接損害或附隨性損害) 請求損害賠償。</strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          本項限制適用於 (a) 與本軟體、服務、第三方網站上的內容 (包括程式碼) 或第三方應用程式相關的任何事項；以及 (b) 在相關法律許可的範圍之內，因為違反合約、保證、擔保或條件、無過失責任、過失或其他侵權行為所主張之訴訟案件。\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          即使 Microsoft 已知悉或應知悉此等損害發生的可能性，此項限制仍然適用。此外，貴用戶所在之州省或國家/地區也可能不允許對附隨性損害、衍生性損害或其他損害加以排除或限制，這種情況也可能造成上述限制或排除規定並不適用於貴用戶。\n        </p>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  <p></p>\n\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div></body></html>",

        "content_text": "# Extension Capabilities Overview\n\nVisual Studio Code offers many ways for extensions to extend its capabilities.\nIt can sometimes be hard to find the right Contribution Points and VS Code API\nto use. This topic splits extension capabilities into a few categories. Each\ncategory describes:\n\n  * Some functionalities your extension could use\n  * Links to more detailed topics for using these functionalities\n  * A few extension ideas\n\nHowever, we also impose restrictions upon extensions to ensure the stability\nand performance of VS Code. For example, extensions cannot access the DOM of\nVS Code UI.\n\nCommon Capabilities are core pieces of functionality that you can use in any\nextension.\n\nSome of these capabilities include:\n\n  * Registering commands, configurations, keybindings, or context menu items.\n  * Storing workspace or global data.\n  * Displaying notification messages.\n  * Using Quick Pick to collect user input.\n  * Open the system file picker to let users select files or folders.\n  * Use the Progress API to indicate long-running operations.\n\nTheming controls the look of VS Code, both the colors of source code in the\neditor and the colors of the VS Code UI. If you've ever wanted to make it look\nlike you're coding the Matrix by making VS Code different shades of green, or\njust wanted to create the ultimate, minimalist grayscale workspace, then\nthemes are for you.\n\n**Extension Ideas**\n\n  * Change colors of your source code.\n  * Change colors of the VS Code UI.\n  * Port an existing TextMate theme to VS Code.\n  * Add custom file icons.\n\nDeclarative Language Features adds basic text editing support for a\nprogramming language such as bracket matching, auto-indentation and syntax\nhighlighting. This is done declaratively, without writing any code. For more\nadvanced language features, like IntelliSense or debugging, see Programmatic\nLanguage Features.\n\n**Extension Ideas**\n\n  * Bundle common JavaScript snippets into an extension.\n  * Tell VS Code about a new programming language.\n  * Add or replace the grammar for a programming language.\n  * Extend an existing grammar with grammar injections.\n  * Port an existing TextMate grammar to VS Code.\n\nProgrammatic Language Features add rich programming language support such as\nHovers, Go to Definition, diagnostic errors, IntelliSense and CodeLens. These\nlanguage features are exposed through the `vscode.languages.*` API. An\nextension can either use these APIs directly, or write a Language Server and\nadapt it to VS Code using the VS Code Language Server library.\n\nAlthough we provide a listing of language features and their intended usage,\nnothing prevents you from using these API creatively. For example, CodeLens\nand Hovers are a great way to present additional information inline, while\ndiagnostic errors can be used to highlight spelling or code style errors.\n\n**Extension Ideas**\n\n  * Add hovers that show sample usage of an API.\n  * Report spelling or linter errors in source code using diagnostics.\n  * Register a new code formatter for HTML.\n  * Provide rich, context-aware IntelliSense.\n  * Add folding, breadcrumbs and outline support for a language.\n\nWorkbench Extensions extend the VS Code Workbench UI. Add new right-click\nactions to the File Explorer, or even build a custom explorer using VS Code's\nTreeView API. And if your extension needs a fully customized user interface,\nuse the Webview API to build your own document preview or UI using standard\nHTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n**Extension Ideas**\n\n  * Add custom context menu actions to the File Explorer.\n  * Create a new, interactive TreeView in the Side Bar.\n  * Define a new Activity Bar view.\n  * Show new information in the Status Bar.\n  * Render custom content using the `WebView` API.\n  * Contribute Source Control providers.\n\nYou can take advantage of VS Code's Debugging functionality by writing\nDebugger Extensions that connect VS Code's debugging UI to a specific debugger\nor runtime.\n\n**Extension Ideas**\n\n  * Connect VS Code's debugging UI to a debugger or runtime by contributing a Debug Adapter implementation.\n  * Specify the languages supported by a debugger extension.\n  * Provide rich IntelliSense and hover information for the debug configuration attributes used by the debugger.\n  * Provide debug configuration snippets.\n\nOn the other hand, VS Code also offers a set of Debug Extension API, with\nwhich you can implement debug-related functionality on top of any VS Code\ndebugger, in order to automate users' debugging experience.\n\n**Extension Ideas**\n\n  * Start debug sessions based on dynamically created debug configurations.\n  * Track the lifecycle of debug sessions.\n  * Create and manage breakpoints programmatically.\n\nTo help make your extension fit seamlessly into the VS Code user interface,\nrefer to the UX Guidelines, where you'll learn the best practices for creating\nextension UI and conventions for following the preferred VS Code workflows.\n\nThere are certain restrictions we impose upon extensions. Here are the\nrestrictions and their purposes.\n\nExtensions have no access to the DOM of VS Code UI. You **cannot** write an\nextension that applies custom CSS to VS Code or adds an HTML element to VS\nCode UI.\n\nAt VS Code, we're continually trying to optimize use of the underlying web\ntechnologies to deliver an always available, highly responsive editor and we\nwill continue to tune our use of the DOM as these technologies and our product\nevolve. To ensure that extensions cannot interfere with the stability and\nperformance of VS Code, and that we can continue to improve the DOM of VS Code\nwithout breaking existing extensions, we run extensions in an Extension Host\nprocess and prevent direct access to the DOM.\n\nA custom style sheet provided by users or extensions would work against the\nDOM structure and class names. These are not documented as we consider them\ninternal. To evolve, refactor, or improve VS Code, we need the freedom to make\nchanges to the user interface. Any change to the DOM can break existing custom\nstyle sheets, resulting in frustration for style sheet providers and a bad\nuser experience with UI glitches coming from the broken style sheet.\n\nInstead, VS Code aims to provide a well-designed extension API supporting UI\ncustomizations. The API is documented, comes with tooling and samples, and is\nkept stable across all upcoming releases of VS Code.\n\n08/07/2025",

Used by the local and remote extension hosts. Extensions need a `main` entry file to run in it.\n  * Browser - Extensions are running in Browser WebWorker runtime. Used by the web extension host. Extensions need a `browser` entry file to run in it. See the Web extensions guide for more details.\n\nThe extension host where an extension is loaded depends on:\n\n  * The available extension hosts given by the configuration of VS Code.\n  * The capabilities of the extension: Can it run in Node.js, and/or the web, or if not indicated, what contributions does it provide?\n  * Where is the extension installed: On the local machine, on the remote machine, or both.\n  * The location the extension prefers: the `extensionKind` property.\n\n`extensionKind` is a property in the extension manifest. It allows extensions\nto specify a preferred running location. That can be the machine that has the\nworkspace (`workspace`) or the user interface (`ui`). If an extension can run\non both, it can specify an order of preference.\n\n  * `\"extensionKind\": [\"workspace\"]` — Indicates the extension requires access to workspace contents and therefore needs to run where the workspace is located. That can be on the local machine or on the remote machine or Codespace. Most extensions fall into this category.\n  * `\"extensionKind\": [\"ui\", \"workspace\"]` — Indicates the extension **prefers** to run as a UI extension, but does not have any hard requirements on local assets, devices, or capabilities. When using VS Code, the extension will run in VS Code's local extension host if it exists locally and means the user does not have to install the extension on the remote. Otherwise, the extension will run in VS Code's workspace extension host if it exists there. When using VS Code for the Web with Codespaces, it will run in the remote extension host always (as no local extension host is available).\n  * `\"extensionKind\": [\"workspace\", \"ui\"]` — Indicates the extension **prefers** to run as a workspace extension, but does not have any hard requirements on accessing workspace contents. When using VS Code, the extension will run in VS Code's workspace extension host if it exists in remote workspace, otherwise will run in VS Code's local extension host if it exists locally. When using VS Code for the Web with Codespaces it will run in the remote extension host always (as no local extension host is available).\n  * `\"extensionKind\": [\"ui\"]` — Indicates the extension **must** run close to the UI because it requires access to local assets, devices, or capabilities or because low latency is required. In the case of VS Code for the Web with Codespaces, where no local extension host is available, such an extension can not load, unless it is also a web extension. It will then be loaded in the web extension host with a limitation that it cannot instantiate a web worker.\n\n**Note:** Prior VS Code releases (<1.40) allowed an extension to specify a\nsingle location as a string but this is deprecated in favor of multiple\nlocations as an array.\n\nIf an extension can run on Node.js and in the browser, a Node.js extension\nhost will be selected if available. There's one exception, when the\nconfiguration is VS Code for the Web with Codespaces and the `extensionKind`\nis set to `ui`, then the web extension host is preferred over the remote\nextension host.\n\nIf an extension is web-only, it will always run on the web extension host,\nregardless of the `extensionKind` setting. We recommend to not define\n`extensionKind` in that case.\n\nVS Code aims to deliver a stable and high performance editor to users, and\nmisbehaving extensions should not impact the user experience. The Extension\nHost in VS Code prevents extensions from:\n\n  * Impacting startup performance\n  * Slowing down UI operations\n  * Modifying the UI\n\nAdditionally, VS Code lets extensions declare their Activation Events and\nloads them lazily. For example, the Markdown extension should only be loaded\nwhen a user opens a Markdown file. This makes sure that extensions do not\nconsume unnecessary CPU and memory.\n\n08/07/2025",

        "content_text": "# Authoring Python Extensions\n\n> **Note** : If you are new to VS Code extension authoring, you may want to\n> read the Your First Extension tutorial first and try creating a simple Hello\n> World extension.\n\nThe Python extension provides APIs for other extensions to work with Python\nenvironments available on the user's machine. Check out @vscode/python-\nextension npm module that includes types and helper utilities to access these\nAPIs from your extension.\n\nThe Python extension template helps get you started building a Visual Studio\nCode extension for your favorite Python tool. It could be a linter, formatter,\nor code analysis, or all of those together. The template will give you the\nbasic building blocks you need to build an extension that integrates your tool\ninto VS Code, and it already has access to the Python APIs mentioned above.\n\nThe extension template has two parts, the extension part and language server\npart. The extension part is written in TypeScript, and language server part is\nwritten in Python over the `pygls` (Python language server) library.\n\nYou will mostly be working on the Python part of the code when using this\ntemplate. You will be integrating your tool with the extension part using the\nLanguage Server Protocol. `pygls` currently works on the version 3.16 of LSP.\n\nThe TypeScript part handles working with VS Code and its UI. The extension\ntemplate comes with a few settings built-in that can be used by your tool. If\nyou need to add new settings to support your tool, you will have to work with\na bit of TypeScript. The extension template has examples for a few settings\nand you can also look at extensions developed by our team for some of the\npopular tools.\n\n  1. VS Code 1.64.0 or greater\n  2. Python 3.7 or greater\n  3. node >= 14.19.0\n  4. npm >= 8.3.0 (`npm` is installed with node, check npm version, use `npm install -g npm@8.3.0` to update)\n  5. Python extension for VS Code\n\nYou should know how to create and work with Python virtual environments.\n\nTo get started, follow the instructions in the template README. There you will\nlearn how to use the template to create your repository and how to install the\nnecessary tools (for example, the nox task runner) and optional dependencies\n(testing support).\n\nThe README has the most up-to-date instructions and also goes into details on\nhow to customize the extension's `package.json` placeholders (`<pythontool-\nmodule>`, `<pythontool-display-name>`, etc.).\n\nAfter creating your extension via the template, it will include the following\nextension contributions. Assume `<pytool-module>` was replaced with `mytool`,\nand `<pytool-display-name>` with`My Tool`:\n\n  1. A command **My Tool: Restart Server** (command ID: `mytool.restart`).\n  2. Following settings: \n     * `mytool.logLevel`\n     * `mytool.args`\n     * `mytool.path`\n     * `mytool.importStrategy`\n     * `mytool.interpreter`\n     * `mytool.showNotification`\n  3. Following triggers for extension activation: \n     * On Language `python`.\n     * On File with `.py` extension found in the opened workspace.\n     * On Command `mytool.restart`.\n  4. Output channel for logging **Output** > **My Tool**.\n\nThe generated `bundled/tool/server.py` file is where you will make most of\nyour changes. `TODO` comments in the file point out the various customization\npoints. Also search for `TODO` comments in other locations in the template,\nsuch as other Python and Markdown files. You will want to review the LICENSE\nfile, even if you want to keep it MIT License.\n\nThere are several example implementations created from the template:\n\nYou can also review the Language Server Protocol specification to better\nunderstand the `pygls` language server integration.\n\nThe template README goes into detail on the development cycle support included\nwith the template. The template has commands and configurations so you can\nbuild, run, debug, and test your extension.\n\nIf you run into problems during development, there is a Troubleshooting\nsection to help with common issues.\n\nBefore publishing your extension, you'll need to update the extension\n`package.json` fields (such as `publisher` and `license`) for your specific\nextension. You also want to update the auxiliary Markdown files\n(`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, etc.).\n\nOnce your extension is ready to publish, there is a `nox` `build-package` task\nto create a `.vsix` file, which you can then upload to your extension\nmanagement page.\n\nIf you are new to creating and publishing VS Code extensions, we recommend you\nfollow best practices outlined in the main VS Code extension authoring topics.\nHere you'll find guidance to help make your extension look great on the\nMarketplace and how to become a verified publisher so that the users feel\nconfident installing your extension.\n\n9/28/2022",
